  -0.14  1 The first things you may notice is that loss ratio is in a very good range, while expense ratio is over market average
  -0.12  1 And I think we're now ahead of the market on claims handling in the Italian market
  -0.20  1 So our loss ratio in the household book is much higher than the market
  -0.08  1 I mentioned that one of the reason why -- one of the positive impact on 2017 is there is also some distortion of reinsurance contract with some deferred profitability on 2017 versus previous years
  -0.22  1 On the price increase, the reality is that in Italy we're suspecting a quite strong price increase in the last actually couple of years
  -0.25  1 And this has been postponed mainly because good underwriting results

  -0.13  1 But Canada, importantly, does highlight a key part of our overall investment thesis and that is one of the strengths that comes with our diversity, now diversity both geographically and in our product as a composite, is that we can overcome setbacks like Canada and still deliver and meet our targets and deliver some pretty good set of results
  -0.08  1 And in Singapore, the disrupted financial advisor model, which is certainly disrupting the market, that helped grow VNB 29% and contributed meaningfully to the profit

  -0.18  1 Central liquidity also remained strong at GBP 2 billion and we expect more cash, more divestitures of Spain and FPI as well as future remittances from our ongoing operations

   0.10 -1 Again, one of the things that I tried to say was that as we look at our experience and longevity, effectively we're at the conservative end of the spectrum and as it appears that trends are showing less improvement in longevity over time, that's causing us to need to release reserves there
  -0.12  1 And then we have seen that the claims experience in some parts of our income protection book has been higher than we were assuming

  -0.09  1 Our strong order backlog was maintained on a like-for-like basis, and that's without yet having booked the Qatar Typhoon contract
  -0.29  1 And that lower pension deficit also drives the reduced deferred tax assets

  -0.08  1 And then, finally, Charles, you mentioned good visibility on future sales, and Pete, I just wondered, when you look at 2018 having delivered the sort of GBP 41 billion order book and 2017, is it possible to give a steer on how much of this year's revs are already contracted or in the bag if you like?  I mean, the last one is in excess of 70%, so I think I mentioned that already in my presentation
  -0.08  1 So these businesses, I've said already, they're well-run businesses, but there is a layer at the enterprise that we've not exploited before that we will continue to push hard

  -0.14  1 As shown on this slide, the 5% reduction in our cost base, excluding litigation and conduct from 2016 to 2017, the biggest driver of lower cost was a reduction in and closure of Non-Core

  -0.09  1 But importantly, this is balanced with production from fixed price or similar contracts, which provide a base of steady, resilient, long-term cash flow
  -0.07  1 Compared to the third quarter, the result reflects higher liquids realizations along with higher production from major project   start-ups, partly offset by higher exploration write-offs
  -0.03  1 Compared to the third quarter, the result reflects stronger refining performance, with availability at 96.1%, the highest in over a decade, more than offset by a slightly below break-even performance in oil supply and trading, seasonally lower industry refining margins and fuels marketing results, more turnaround activity and, of course, the absence of earnings following the divestment of the SECCO joint venture in our petrochemicals business
  -0.14  1 This was higher than our guidance of $350 million as a result of adverse foreign exchange impacts
  -0.14  1 This reflects a benefit from the reassessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets
  -0.12  1 We will ensure we remain robust to the downside in the event oil prices were to drop below $50 per barrel

   0.08 -1 Here, you can see the split across our customer-facing divisions with Centrica Consumer profit about flat compared to 2016, but significantly down in Centrica Business
   0.12 -1 Looking now in more detail at Centrica Consumer, where operating profit fell slightly to GBP 890 million
   0.06 -1 Services operating profit declined by 4% to GBP 247 million, as strong cost efficiency delivery was not able to fully offset a 10% fall in gross margin from the lower average customer holdings and increased pension costs

   0.07 -1 External factors, specifically weather, foreign exchange movements and the impact of the prepayment tariff cap, reduced operating profit by around GBP 134 million
   0.17 -1 However, our efficiency program delivery of GBP 219 million largely offset these factors
   0.14 -1 Now let me turn to Centrica Business, where full year profit was down 67% to GBP 161 million
   0.08 -1 Adjusted operating cash flow fell 43%, reflecting working capital recovery in 2016 in UK Business and materially lower operating profit in North American business
   0.07 -1 In Central Power Generation, operating profit was down 53% to GBP 35 million, principally reflecting 2% lower generation volumes and a 4% fall in realized prices in our nuclear joint venture results
   0.10 -1 In a similar format to Centrica Consumer, here are the primary drivers of the year-on-year reduction in business operating profit
   0.09 -1 For the gas supply business, consumption was broadly flat, while warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters reduced the opportunity for wholesale optimization
   0.07 -1   In our electricity supply, we saw a 7% reduction in customer consumption, partly driven by a 3% fall in customer sites, but also the impact of increasing energy efficiency measures
   0.12 -1 However, the biggest driver of reduced profitability in 2017 was the power supply business, shown in light blue on the chart
   0.06 -1 Realized margins were also impacted by reductions in customer volumes as commercial customers increased their take-up of energy efficiency measures, including distributed generation
  -0.06  1 Although the segment operating loss increased to GBP 53 million, driven by planned incremental investment in growth, we are seeing good momentum on building the future order book and recurring revenue streams
  -0.05  1 We expect Distributed Energy & Power to deliver continued revenue and gross margin growth in 2018, although unlike Connected Home, we will continue to make further investment to drive this growth, and therefore, expect the current year operating loss to be similar to that in 2017
   0.12 -1   Energy Marketing & Trading reported a 35% reduction in operating profit despite continued gross margin expansion from the core route to market trading and LNG activities
   0.14 -1 This will create a year-on-year headwind for Energy Marketing & Trading operating profit in aggregate this year, and we would expect 2018 operating profit to be no more than half the level of 2017
   0.18 -1 Production in Europe was down 5% as a result of our decision to undertake asset integrity works at Morecambe to help improve safety, operational efficiency and underpin the residual life of the asset
   0.10 -1 As boilers become more intelligent and home energy management becomes more   digital with data analytics providing new insights and opportunities for the customer, we have had to develop the ability to install and maintain new home energy management systems
   0.50 -1 Third, we must improve the effectiveness with which we operate in go-to-market
  -0.05  1 As you can see, including other cost reductions outside of the core program, our actions from 2015 have resulted in a reduction of our overall nominal controllable costs from GBP 5 billion per annum to GBP 4.5 billion while eating adverse foreign exchange impact and inflation and funding our growth
   0.12 -1 Given the nature of these customer segments and channels, I am convinced we could not have improved their economics
  -0.14  1 Losing these accounts was a major driver in the increase in gross margin per account I mentioned earlier
  -0.08  1 The higher-value impacts are shown by the green bars, where we've seen a net loss of 180,000 accounts, which is actually an improvement of 96,000, relative to the 12-month picture we showed to the end of June, as we saw growth in both British Gas services and Connected Home more than offsetting losses from other channels
   0.05 -1 Zooming in on UK Home and looking at the interaction between gross margin and cost efficiency, you can see that, although gross margin has been falling over the last 3 years, our cost efficiency delivery has been keeping pace with the gross margin decline, so maintaining EBIT margins per account at about GBP 39
  -0.06  1 The ability to maintain competitive pricing, healthy unit gross margin quality and drive cost efficiency is crucial in the face of the potential default tariff cap in the U.K
   0.08 -1 Secondly, as a result of our own cost efficiencies to date, our current SVT is cheaper than 85% of the SVTs in the market and is GBP 41 below the average of large supplier SVTs
  -0.08  1 When we introduce our new default tariff to replace the SVT, which will happen by the 31st of March, we intend to continue to make it competitive relative to the market
   0.09 -1 Clearly, depending on the level of the cap initially, it's possible that the reduction in gross margin from the cap may happen more quickly than our cost efficiency can keep up, in which case, relative to our plans, we could see some EBIT margin compression, particularly in 2019
  -0.10  1 As you can see from the graph, this on-demand offer continues to accelerate and complements our own contract relationships through British Gas
  -0.11  1 The recent volatility in results is a concern, but returns have been generally attractive and the business has the potential to grow
  -0.22  1 Gross revenue increased by 6% and by 34% on an underlying basis when reflecting disposals and discontinued activities
  -0.08  1 We will look to create synergies between Centrica Storage and Spirit while continuing to explore the commercial optionality of the Easington terminal
  -0.04  1 In terms of the dividend, we expect to maintain the current dividend level out to 2020 subject to 2 conditions: firstly, being able to generate adjusted operating cash flow on average within the targeted range; and secondly, to manage net debt to within the range of GBP 2.25 billion to GBP 3.25 billion
  -0.12  1 It's, therefore, imperative that we focus on the things we can control to underpin our performance and that is what we're doing
   0.08 -1 My read is that you ended up seeing a bang on consensus for 2017 but with EBIT a little bit lower than expected, plus some positives that you mentioned in the tax line
   0.12 -1 In terms of 2017 and the EBIT, Sam, there were a handful of things that we saw post the trading update in December that affected the full year profitability
   0.09 -1 And I especially highlighted the issue of, while we are driving costs down, if they get out of sync with the gross margin impact of the tariff cap -- and again, we don't know what the formula is -- then, of course, we would see an impression on our EBIT   margins until our cost efficiency program caught up
  -0.05  1 It is something I'm very, very conscious of is the amount of change we're going through in the business, but just to go back to that complaints statistics, that's 1 million complaints less over the last 3 years in UK Home Energy, whilst going through cost reductions, whilst going through the headcount reductions, whilst improving service more broadly
  -0.12  1 Obviously, let's get there first, but we have to recognize, as you say, first of all that the balance sheet is quite strong
  -0.14  1 A positive interpretation of that is that must require a number of sources of new cash flow to overcome some of the decline
   0.33 -1 I don't know how successful that will be
  -0.13  1 Clearly, what we have said is that we expect, which is quite a strong word, that subject to the cash flow generation and staying in the net debt range, that we would expect their dividend to remain at the current level
   0.11 -1 And then, on margins and profitability, you did highlight the single biggest factor, which is that gross margin's down
   0.50 -1 This is an opportune scheme
  -0.07  1 So we do get this play of an impact on the cost base, which even if the pound is weakening is helping us from a revenue perspective, but is then offset from an underlying cost perspective
  -0.05  1 And some commentators, notably Shell, pointing to that and saying, "Look, it's quite difficult to predict what demand is and maybe that glut isn't there." We're still assuming it is but others are being more positive in terms of their outlook on supply demand

  -0.02  1 Applying this formula to our results, our 120 basis points EBIT margin expansion in the year can be explained as follows: 50 basis points of margin expansion from volume leverage based on the 2.2% volume growth in the year, 230 basis points expansion from revenue leverage based on the 3.6% growth in currency-neutral revenue per case in the year, 10 basis points expansion from our cost productivity initiatives, 100 basis points contraction from the combined impact of currency and input costs

  -0.14  1 Water grew by 3% in the year, with growth in Established and Emerging segments and decline in Developing
  -0.12  1 Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria, the countries where we will retain the Nestea brand, delivered   volume growth, while other countries were in decline in 2017
  -0.05  1 Good performance in Water, growth in Coca- Cola Zero following the launch of the new 0-sugar formula and in Fanta with the slider bottle were not enough to offset declines in Coca-Cola regular and ready-to-drink tea

  -0.14  1 You mentioned in your statement that, without that bad debt provision, EBIT would have been up year-on-year
   0.12 -1 Now in particular to the channel mix impact that you asked, we do not expect that this channel mix is going to be better in the future
   0.10 -1 So from a transactional impact perspective, that generates probably a muted impact, whereas due to the strengthening of the euro against the dollar, the gross rate is very high
  -0.05  1 When it comes to volume and revenue, as Zoran was saying earlier, we are looking at potentially a rebalancing with some acceleration of the volume growth compared to '17 and some potentially small slowdown in the revenue per case currency-neutral growth compared to '17 again

  -0.20  1 So quite material volume growth across all the commodities
  -0.06  1 However, in volume terms, in metric tonnes, it is growing; but in heating value, in fact, there's no growth because we're getting decline in calorific value being mined from these various mines

  -0.05  1 Then breaking down that organic constant currency performance, we saw Environmental & Analysis growing strongly through the year, Process Safety growing in the second half, but not as fast as in the first half; solid performance from Infrastructure Safety and Medical, as we expected, recovering to growth in the second half
  -0.04  1 The obvious point is the benefit of diversity of the group in the markets we serve but also the value of those long-term growth drivers, so increasing health and safety regulation, increasing demand for health care, and life-critical resources you see playing out when you look at the widespread growth across all of these end markets

  -0.11  1 Revenue for the full year was up 3% on 2016, mainly in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and Securities Services
  -0.08  1 This was partly balanced by a 4 basis point increase from higher deposit margins, particularly in Asia and in Global Liquidity and Cash Management

   0.17 -1 So when we come on to May, I think there are things that we can do that previously we would have not expected to be able to achieve
  -0.11  1 Beginning last year, we found it a little bit more difficult, but then it eased off, and actually, we've been able to deliver those sorts of returns, which we then beat when it comes through the P&L account and pretty consistently now through sort of 18 months post Brexit
  -0.06  1 And you go back to those big sites and actually really understanding how to appeal to customers beyond the traditional sales model is one of the keys to the potential to drive out more volume and more value where we have large land holdings, and absorption can be the limiting factor

  -0.22  1 Arresting that decline, getting ourselves back to competitive levels of growth is something that our suppliers clearly appreciate

   0.50 -1   Customer satisfaction is there for both
  -0.04  1 But critically, the focus on capital discipline, free cash generation, paying a dividend which over time is twice covered, we are just under 4x covered today, so there's a lot of growth potential within that dividend putting aside earnings growth, which equally gives us the potential to increase the dividend

  -0.03  1 But in the core bits of the turnaround of the Thai business and the restructuring of the whole proposition, if I look at core food, last 4 weeks, 3.2% like-for-like gives you the best indication, stripping out all the bulk and the couponing and was that -- Tony, do you want to say anything else on top of that?

  -0.10  1 As you recall, we set us over a target of a GBP 20 billion gross reduction now to the end of 2018, so we're a year ahead of schedule on that
  -0.12  1 We also now expect restructuring charges to be around GBP 1.5 billion higher over 2018 and '19 relative to previous guidance
  -0.09  1 Ross and I remain very focused on taking costs out as quickly as we can without damaging our customer franchises or our controlled environment
  -0.07  1 Thirdly, on restructuring costs, we are guiding for these to be materially higher, but we think, largely for the right reasons, that should be viewed as helping deliver much lower operating costs by 2020 and beyond
  -0.07  1 But the cost of this transformation resulting in a more flexible and lower longer- term cost base will be higher investment and restructuring costs in the near term
  -0.05  1 So yes, it has a drag, but it's in the plan, and always was in the plan within the numbers since we sort of started and did an analyst presentation back in '15, and those numbers really haven't changed, other than the fact, as Ewen mentioned earlier, we've been increasing revenues year-on-year

  -0.05  1 This is going to become critically important as Amazon, in particular, and Alibaba and Tencent as well, start to build their platforms, and particularly Amazon, according to some estimates, the advertising platform last year was up to about $2.5 billion, $3 billion, so it's a tiddler in relation to Google and Facebook, who were at $100 billion and $40 billion, respectively
