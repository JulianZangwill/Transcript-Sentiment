INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the IHG Preliminary Results. We are now live in an
auditorium, where you'll hear holding music until the call begins. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for
holding.

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

All right. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being here. I'm Keith Barr, Chief Executive Officer
of IHG. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our 2017 full year results presentation. Paul
Edgecliffe-Johnson, our Chief Financial Officer, will talk you through some of the financial performance in a
moment, but let me first share some highlights.

We delivered another strong year of performance in 2017. Solid RevPAR increases in the U.S. and globally,
as well as a 4% net system size growth, our best since 2009, drove underlying fee revenue up 5%. Taking
advantage of our global scale, we again expanded our fee margin and increased underlying EPS by 22%,
and our disciplined use of capital and high-quality fee streams continue to generate significant levels
of cash flow. Reflecting this strong performance and our confident outlook, we have increased our total
annual ordinary dividend by 11%.

Back in August last year, when I first spoke to you as CEO, I talked about the success of IHG's strategic
model and the crucial role that it has played in our consistent market outperformance over the past few
years. I also talked about my intention to work our model harder in the future.

Since then, that's what we've been focusing on, identifying clear ways in which we can leverage the
considerable strengths of our business and be more efficient, releasing capacity to better capitalize on
opportunities to accelerate our growth. And today, we are announcing a series of strategic initiatives that
map across the key elements of our model. These build on our existing strategy and will help us produce
even stronger results. These initiatives represent a meaningful change in how we run our business and
they're aimed at positioning us to deliver industry-leading net rooms growth over the medium term as well
as continued strong returns for our shareholders.

In order to fund these plans, we are undertaking a comprehensive company-wide efficiency program,
which we started in August of 2017. The program will release $125 million in annual savings across IHG's
P&L and system fund for reinvestment by the end of 2020. Over that period, our disciplined approach to
managing our balance sheet and capital allocation will remain unchanged.

We are confident that these actions will enable us to deliver high-quality, long-term sustainable growth in
cash flows and continue our record for maximizing shareholder returns.

Before I discuss our initiatives in more detail, let me hand over to Paul, who will first take you through our
results for 2017.

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson
CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone.

We're pleased to report another year of solid financial performance with growth in all our key markets. On
a reported basis, revenue increased 4% and operating profit increased 7%. As I've done in the past, I'll
focus my commentary on our underlying numbers as this gives the clearest explanation of our financial
results.

On that basis, we translated 5% revenue growth into 8% operating profit growth by leveraging the
scalability of our asset-light business and continuing our focus on relentless cost management. This

allowed us to increase our fee margin by 140 basis points year-on-year whilst continuing to invest for
growth.

Interest charges fell by $2 million due to the impact of the weaker pound, a reduction on our bonds
coupon following our refinancing in 2016, offset by higher average net debt levels during the year.

Our reported tax rate stayed at 30% and we expect that to come down for 2018 due to U.S. tax reform.
I'll talk more about that later.

The weighted average numbers of shares decreased by 9% due to the cumulative effect of a share
consolidations following the special dividend payments made in May 2016 and May 2017. In aggregate,
this performance enabled us to increase our underlying earnings per share by 22%.

Looking now at our levers of growth. We added 48,000 rooms to the system. At the same time as adding
these new high-quality representations of our brands, we remain focused on removing underperforming
properties, exiting 17,000 rooms. This is at the low end of the 2% to 3% range that we typically expect,
but will tick back up slightly in 2018 before trending back down again over the medium term. This brought
net system size growth to 4%, our best performance in 8 years. Combined with RevPAR growth of 2.7%,
this drove total underlying fee revenue up 5%.

On-screen now is a new slide. I am aware it contains a lot of information, but I thought it would help to
explain our underlying performance more clearly. The drivers of our fee-based model are well-understood.
Fee revenue growth is achieved by opening more rooms and leveraging the power of IHG's enterprise to
grow the average revenue generated per open room. Standard industry metrics of annual rooms growth
and comparable RevPAR growth are good properties to understand how this translates into incremental fee
revenue over time. However, they do not reflect several factors that impact overall in the year fee growth:
the phasing of openings and removals; changes in relative brand and geographic mix' and the ramp-up
of newly opened hotels. So what we have also provided in this hotel is rooms available and total RevPAR
growth. These provide a much more linear relationship with fee revenues.

Rooms available measures the aggregate number of rooms available for sale throughout the year and so
reflects the phasing of costs -- of hotels coming in and out of our system. Total RevPAR includes rooms
that have opened or exited in the last 2 years, and therefore, reflects our change in mix. Our focused
growth strategy means that we direct our efforts on not just the largest markets but those which are the
fastest growing. This often means that we're adding hotels at the same time as the demand drivers in
these markets are still being built, which inevitably means lower levels of absolute RevPAR, especially in
the early years.

For us, the distinction is most evident in Asia, Middle East and Africa and in Greater China, where we
have been way ahead of the competition when it comes to growing our business to ensure it's aligned
with future demand. The faster we expand in developing markets in these regions, the more we will see
this dynamic in our fee revenue growth. But these fees are, of course, incremental to those we receive in
established markets. So this will continue to be positive for our top line.

In the long time -- in the long term, as these markets mature, they will support sustained RevPAR growth.
To demonstrate this, we have analyzed the performance of the 460 hotels that entered our system in 2012
and 2013. By 2017, these hotels will have been fully operationally ramped up, and we can see that, as
expected, the absolute RevPAR generated by the developing market cohort was significantly lower than
those in the more established markets.

Critically, however, the RevPAR growth rate achieved by the developing market properties over the same
time period was twice as fast as the growth achieved by those in the established markets. And as these
markets continue to mature, we would expect them to drive even more RevPAR growth, demonstrating
their long-term viability and value.

I will now take you through our 2017 performance in each of our regions in more detail. Before I do so,
you may have seen that on the 17th of April, we will be issuing restated comparatives to reflect some
changes to our reporting from the 1st of January, 2018. This includes the impact of IFRS 15 and our new

regional structure, which Keith will talk more about later. I will be hosting a seminar the same day to go
through all of this in detail.

So moving on to trading and starting with the Americas, where U.S. industry demand has been at record
levels for 80 of the last 82 months. Consequently, our hotels in the region are continuing to drive record
occupancies of nearly 70%. This meant predominantly rate-driven RevPAR increases, with the Americas
up 1.6% and the U.S. up 1.2%. In the fourth quarter, the U.S. was up 3% with continued noise from
the ongoing impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the shift in timing of Jewish observances into
September.

What we do know, however, is our underlying U.S. performance marked a significant step-up from that
in the third quarter. Underlying franchise profit grew 1%. Good growth in royalty revenue was partly
offset by the impact of the financial incentives associated with our Crowne Plaza Accelerate program, the
annualized cost of up-weighting our development resource and the delayed payroll tax credit, which we
now expect to recognize in 2018.

Underlying managed profit was up 11%, although this is a little misleading. Our calculation of underlying
is designed to normalize the year-on-year foreign exchange movements by restating our results at the
prior year FX rate. This normally works well. But in the case of our income derived from Venezuela, whilst
having no impact on our reported result, the extreme currency fluctuations have distorted this underlying
calculation. Adjusting for this, true underlying managed profits were up 2%, driven by 5% rooms growth
and lower costs associated with our 20% interest in the InterContinental New York Barclay. These benefits
were partly offset by lower hotel termination fees and challenging trading conditions at one property.

Regional overheads benefited from lower-than-anticipated claims in our U.S. health care program,
something we don't expect to continue into 2018.

We opened 22,000 rooms, our highest level since 2010, and we signed 37,000 rooms, including 16,000
for Holiday Inn Express, up 15% from last year; and 4,000 rooms for avid hotels in its first 3 months
of franchise sales. It is pleasing to note that as we had expected, our avid signings do not appear to be
slowing the growth in Express.

Moving now to Europe, where RevPAR was up 6.3% for the year. In the U.K., RevPAR was up almost 5%
in both London and the provinces, with some slowing of growth in the capital in the fourth quarter due to
strong comparables and a reduction in U.S. inbound travels as the pound strengthened against the dollar.

In France, RevPAR was up 7% with double-digit growth in Paris as demand continued to recover following
the terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016. This strong RevPAR performance, combined with 3% rooms
growth, translates into underlying revenue growth of 10% and profit growth of 16%.

We opened 5,000 rooms and signed a further 9,000, almost half of which were in Germany, marking our
fourth record year of signings in Europe's second-largest lodging market.

Looking now at our Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, where RevPAR was up 1.5%. In the Middle
East, RevPAR declined 4% in the year, primarily due to the ongoing impact of industry-wide supply
growth. Performance in the rest of the region was strong with RevPAR up 4%. On an underlying basis,
revenue was up 5% and operating profit up 12%, driven by double-digit rooms growth and a reduction in
overheads.

We opened a record 11,000 rooms, including 3,500 rooms in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. These rooms relate to
the remaining portion of the 5,000-room signing that we announced in 2015. On an annualized basis, we
continue to expect these rooms to generate around $1 million in fees, given the highly seasonal market
they operate in. We signed 13,000 rooms in the year, our highest since 2008.

Finally, moving to Greater China, where we continue to outperform the industry. RevPAR in Mainland
China grew almost 7%, benefiting from strong transient meetings and corporate demand in Tier 1 cities.
Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities were also strong, driven by good meetings business and helped by some weak
comparables in the second half. Improved trading conditions in Hong Kong and Macau led to RevPAR
growth of 3% and 11%, respectively.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

The combination of strong RevPAR and net rooms growth increased underlying revenue by 9%. Underlying
profit grew 6% -- grew 16% as we continue to leverage the scale of the operational platform we have built
in Greater China. Room openings totaled a record 11,000, taking our system size in the region to over
100,000 rooms and 300 hotels. Within this, we now have more than 100 Holiday Inn Express hotels open,
of which 7 are under our Franchise Plus model. Demand for this new format continues to be strong, with
54 signings during 2017. Total signings for the region of 24,000 rooms represents our best in 10 years,
taking the total signs in the past 3 years to more than 62,000 rooms.

At the end of December last year, we published guidance on the impact of the U.S. tax reform bill. We
continue to expect this to benefit our group effective tax rate by mid- to single-digit percentage points
from the 1st of January, 2018, taking it to the mid- to low 20s. This benefit will flow through to our cash
tax rate, which we now expect to be in the high single-digit percentage rate in 2018 due to tax payments
made on account in 2017. This will trend up closer to the P&L rate over time.

The measures outlined in the U.S. tax bill also resulted in a one-off exceptional credit to the P&L of $108
million in 2017, most of which relates to the rebasing of our deferred tax liabilities. This will be realized in
cash terms over a long period from 2018.

In recent years, we have maintained a relentless focus on removing costs from the business to improve
our efficiency levels and allowing us to invest to support future growth and drive margin accretion. We've
taken many actions, including the establishment of a centralized procurement function, off-shoring certain
back office roles such as our centralized accounting services and adopting a zero-based budgeting process.
These actions have been highly effective, driving a 10% reduction in our gross overheads over the past
3 years and delivering material fee margin gains over the same period. So our steps to date have had a
big impact. But there is a limit to what we can deliver each year without making broader structural and
process changes to our business. This is what we have now been working on.

As Keith mentioned in his introduction, new strategic initiatives are designed to drive industry-leading
net rooms growth over the medium term. But the reality is that in this business, there's a requirement
to invest ahead of profit delivery. It takes time to generate meaningful new fee streams. And we are
focused on ensuring that such investments for the medium term does not lead to an erosion of short-term
profitability.

To deliver this, we are implementing a significant restructure of the group. We will be simplifying our
organizational structure, making it leaner and flatter. We will outsource more non-core activities, introduce
increased levels of automation through more self-service reporting through to using robotics for manual
processing activities. We will also be pooling our expertise into global centers of excellence, removing
areas of duplicated activity and maximizing our scale benefits. This will realize -- this will release $125
million of additional capacity for reinvestment into our strategic initiatives across IHG's P&L and the
system fund by 2020.

Our plan is that on an annual basis, the delivery of these savings matches the ramp-up of spend on the
new initiatives. As a result, on a full year group-wide basis, the net impact of new investments and of the
savings overall should be minimal, although there could be some noise from half to half due to phasing.
We are confident that these changes will ensure the delivery of industry-leading net rooms growth over
the medium term. We are also confident that we can continue to drive strong fee margin growth into the
future by our ongoing relentless focus on cost efficiency.

Looking at the efficiency program on a more granular basis, we expect $50 million of the capacity for
reinvestment come from savings in our P&L with the remaining $75 million from savings in the system
fund. Keith will talk in more detail about the initiatives later, but in broad terms, within our P&L, we expect
our central functions to realize around 2/3 of the savings, with the remaining 1/3 coming from the regions.
This capacity will be used to fund the evolution of our owner proposition and the launch of new brands.

In the system fund, the increased capacity will be used to strengthen our loyalty offering, enhance
revenue delivery and drive growth in our existing brands. The savings themselves will start in 2018 with
approximately 80% achieved by 2019 and the full benefit realized across both P&L and system fund by
2020.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

Given the comprehensive nature of these actions and the structural and process changes to the
organization that are required to be implemented, we expect to incur around $200 million in exceptional
cash costs in relation to the program. These costs will be charged to the P&L and system fund, broadly
in line with the savings delivered. To date, $31 million of this total has been spent, with most of the
remaining balance expected in 2018.

Moving on now to cash flow. Our business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash, with
underlying free cash flow in 2017 of $516 million. This was broadly flat year-on-year after adjusting in
2016 for the $95 million receipt related to credit card partnership agreements and the $31 million cost
incurred in relation to our efficiency program. Over time, we've built out a system fund surplus, which we
have now started to spend down, with $67 million reinvested behind marketing, loyalty and technology in
2017 and a further $60 million expected in 2018. We intend to fully spend the remaining surplus in 2018
with the balance included within the exceptional cash cost associated with our efficiency program.

Our growth CapEx was covered 1.8x by our underlying operating cash flows, whilst our permanently
invested maintenance capital and key money covered 5.5x. The net cash movement and regearing of the
balance sheet enabled us to pay a $400 million special dividend to shareholders in May. Importantly, this
was our first special dividend to be funded fully from operations. After taking into account a $120 million
adverse impact from currency translation, net debt increased by $345 million to $1.85 billion.

I've talked on many occasions about our priorities for uses of cash. Our first focus is to reinvest capital to
drive growth. The capital expenditure needs of the business have not changed. We continue to execute
against the approach that we set out previously with growth CapEx of $342 million and net CapEx of $227
million during 2017. Maintenance and key money capital expenditure totaled $115 million. Recyclable
investments of $85 million were offset by net proceeds of $79 million, most of which was from the sale
of our stake in Avendra. Gross system fund capital expenditure totaled $142 million, with $36 million of
system fund depreciation and amortization received through working capital.

Our medium-term guidance remains unchanged at up to $350 million gross per annum, and we expect
our recyclable investments to even out over the medium term, resulting in net CapEx of $150 million per
annum. In the short term, this type of expenditure will continue to be lumpy.

As well as using cash to reinvest behind our long term, we want to generate sufficient funds to support
growth in the ordinary dividend. We have announced today that the 2017 final dividend will increase by
11% to $0.71 per share. This brings the total dividend for 2017 to $1.04 per share, also up 11%, and
takes the total return to shareholders to $13 billion, 40% of which has been generated from operational
cash flows.

Looking forward, our long-term funding sources are secure with our first bond maturity not until 2022. We
also have access to a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility for additional cash requirements, of which only
$300 million is currently utilized.

Lastly, whether it's further cash available, which is deemed through the surplus, we will return this
to shareholders as we have demonstrated over the past 14 years. This is all in the context of our
commitment to an investment-grade credit rating, the best external proxy for which is net debt-to-EBITDA
of 2 to 2.5x. We are happy to be at the top end of this in the current economic climate.

The efficiency program we are undertaking will free up capacity to reinvest to drive sustained growth
into the future. The costs we will incur to achieve this in 2018 means that the surplus fund we will have
available will not be of a quantum that would justify paying an additional capital return to shareholders
this calendar year but we remain committed to doing so in the future.

Thank you, and I'll now hand you back to Keith.

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Thanks, Paul.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

I now want to spend a moment giving you a sense of the broader context against which we're announcing
our strategic initiatives. The success of our strategy to date has been borne out in our financial results.
We've grown our rooms asset in the industry, driven double-digit fee revenue growth and increased
earnings per share more than 50% over the past 3 years. We've also consistently delivered against our
key commercial metrics, driving meaningful improvements in Guest Love, loyalty contribution and system
delivery, which has driven superior returns for our hotel owners.

But we are not complacent. We know that we must continue this strong performance for years to come.
Our sector is as dynamic and fast changing as ever and it's supported by significant tailwinds that
will drive up demand for hotels over the next few decades. These tailwinds cover everything from the
globalization of travel and positive demographic trends to the attractiveness of the branded hotel industry
to owners and investors. And having scale is crucial. The big 5 branded global players, of which IHG is
one, now have 24% of the world's rooms, and crucially, 60% of the active pipeline, meaning they will
collectively continue to take share and increase their relative scale against the rest of the industry.

We also know that the vast majority of high-value guests prefer branded hotels as they are more confident
of the experience they will receive and the value they will get.

When it comes to hotel owners, big branded players are appealing for several reasons. They have the
scale and the resources to provide operational support, the specialist expertise and technology solutions
required to deliver low-cost revenue to hotels and the capacity and capability to maintain and grow a
compelling portfolio of brands. With our powerful global enterprise, which is driving strong performance
across our full estate, IHG is well positioned to continue to grow, but the competition is not standing still.
That's why we're implementing new strategic initiatives to accelerate our growth, find efficiencies to fund
that growth and ensure that we secure our position as one of the industry leaders for years to come.

We will do this by making each element of our model work harder. You'll recognize our model here on the
slide, which we have evolved and fine-tuned as we look to accelerate our growth and at which I mentioned
earlier, maps across to each of our strategic initiatives. I'll talk about each of these in more detail in a
moment, and they revolve around the following: focusing and redeploying resources to better leverage
our scale; strengthening our loyalty program; enhancing revenue delivery by continuing to prioritize
digital and technological innovation; evolving our industry-leading franchise proposition; strengthening our
existing brands; and adding new ones where we see the greatest potential for growth.

It goes without saying brands are at the heart of everything we do in that every single part of our model
ultimately evolves -- revolves around our brand portfolio.

Back in September 2017, we announced several changes to our operating structure, which became
effective on the 1st of January this year. Firstly, within our regional operations, we brought together 2
of our current divisions, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa, whilst leaving Greater China and the
America regions largely unchanged. This structure allows us to focus on those markets that matter most
whilst leveraging best practices to drive growth. Kenneth Macpherson, previously our CEO for Greater
China, leads the new EMEAA region based out of the U.K. Jolyon Bulley has taken over from Kenneth
in China. Jolyon has a long and very successful career in the hospitality industry, during which he has
had experience of running hotel operations in Asia and China and most recently was our Chief Operating
Officer for our Americas region.

Looking at each of the regions in turn and starting with the Americas, which is our most important
geography. It compresses more than 60% of our open rooms and 45% of our pipeline and delivers almost
3/4 of group operating profit. It's predominantly a franchise business. We've delivered double-digit growth
there in the past 3 years, and this momentum looks set to continue. It's a $190 billion market expected to
grow by almost 50% over the next 8 years. Almost 2/3 of that market is branded and IHG has a 7% of the
current industry room supply but 13% of the active pipeline so we're well positioned for future growth.

Moving to Greater China, and whilst it only represents a relatively small portion of our open rooms
and profits today, it has been growing quickly and accounts for nearly 30% of our pipeline, so will be
increasingly important to the group as a whole in the future. The market potential is also significant.
The Chinese hospitality industry is set to grow by 60% in the next 8 years and we'll take a considerable

share of that with 21% of the active industry pipeline. That's more than 5x our current supply share. Our
strategy for this region is to drive further system size growth and to increase profitability by introducing
new operating models such as franchising for some of our full-service brands and bringing new brands to
China where we see opportunities. And we'll continue to build on our successful strategy to penetrate and
build scale and presence in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.

Looking at our newest region, EMEAA, this covers a sizable geographic area, encompassing 72 countries
across 4 continents. It represents around 1/4 of our rooms and pipeline and contributes 20% of the
group's profits. The size of the overall EMEAA market, as well as its future growth potential, is actually
larger than that of the Americas.

In what is a highly fragmented region, accessing this growth means up-weighting our investments in those
individual submarkets that matter the most to IHG, both in terms of overall value but also where we can
leverage our scale to accelerate our growth. To be clear, our enterprise will continue to effectively support
hotels across the nearly 100 countries we operate in, but going forward, will be much more focused and
targeted increasing our investments and the level of support against the markets with the greatest growth
potential.

Moving back to the broader organizational changes. We've also created a new integrated commercial and
technology organization under the leadership of Eric Pearson, who was previously our Chief Information
Officer. He has extensive experience across the marketing and digital, so is uniquely qualified for the job.
This change brings together our sales, channels, revenue management and technology capabilities into
one function, maximizing revenue delivery into our hotels. It also allows us to free up capacity to drive
efficiencies and will enable us to bring new products and services to the market much more quickly.

Claire Bennett, our new Chief Marketing Officer, joined IHG from American Express in October, and
she's already making a significant impact on the business. Her new global marketing organization
brings together and strengthens our brand, loyalty and marketing capabilities to drive greater agility
and efficiencies. Claire has a proven track record of running marketing functions across B2B and B2C
businesses and has a strong understanding of the travel sector from her time with American Express.

We worked hard to shape and evolve our brands in recent years to make sure they're fit and ready
for future growth. And as you can see from today's results, they performed well and driven strong
performance across the group. But if I'm completely frank, which I can be as I used to run that part of
the organization, we still have a significant opportunity to drive even better performance here. We can
improve the efficiency of our spend, increase the impact of our marketing initiatives and better leverage
technology and data to drive even stronger performance. This new structure empowers global brand
category leads who will be accountable for delivering global brand performance and growth. And by
enabling a shared services model means we can make the most of our scaled benefits in delivering cost-
effective, high-quality marketing.

The changes we're making are not limited to commercial, tech and marketing. The executive committee
has worked together across the whole organization, is structured in a way that best supports our growth
plans while freeing up capacity for reinvestment to drive growth.

Moving on to IHG Rewards Club, which is one of our greatest assets. By building long-term and trusted
relationships with our guests, we drive highly profitable revenue into our hotels. Our loyal program
members are 7x more likely to book through IHG's direct channels, bringing significant distribution cost
savings to our owners. These strong relationships also provide us with incredibly rich and valuable data to
help us market more efficiently and effectively across the entirety of our customer base.

Our focus on loyalty also brings marketing efficiencies for IHG and owners. Around 75% of point-earning
revenue comes from those members who have opted in to engaging with us more proactively, which
allows us to deliver a more personalized and tailored offer. These guests require little additional marketing
cost to engage with, so we can use our funds instead to acquire further high-value customers.

As you can see, loyalty is an important driver of hotel revenues and we've taken significant actions over
the past couple of years to enhance IHG Rewards Club. In 2015, we introduced Spire Elite, a new top

tier for our most valuable and loyal guests. We also restructured the other IHG Rewards Club tiers so
it's easier for members to reach elite status. We want to build genuine loyalty with as many guests as
possible and this move has made these levels even more attainable. These changes have yielded some
great results with 17% increase in our Spire Elite members, who now deliver 1/4 of our loyalty revenue.

In 2016, we started to roll a member-exclusive preferential rate, Your Rate by IHG Rewards Club, which
members receive when booking through our direct channels. We completed the rollout during last year,
and in the 12 months after launch, we drove direct channel growth up more than 3 points and the retail
segment growth up 2 points.

During 2017, we focused on launching new strategic partnerships that provide extra benefits for our
loyalty members. These included partnerships with Amazon, Kindle, Shell, OpenTable, Grubhub, as well --
and the ride-hailing service, DiDi, in China. These actions have been very successful, helping to drive our
loyalty contribution up 3.5 percentage points over 3 years.

Looking ahead, further strengthening IHG Rewards Club to drive contribution even higher is one of our
priorities. We will continue to focus on creating a more differentiated loyalty offer and will be looking at
further potential opportunities to secure more strategic partnerships to enhance the value of the program.

IHG's revenue delivery enterprise supports our entire global estate. This covers everything from our
channel distribution system and digital marketing to our revenue management tools and operating
expertise. On average, IHG delivers 76% of rooms revenue to our hotels in our system, up 5 percentage
points over the last 3 years. Within this, digital is our largest channel and comprises revenues from our
web and mobile devices, including our apps. 22% of rooms revenue to our hotels, totaling $4.6 billion, is
now delivered via our digital channel. And we've more than doubled mobile revenue in the last 3 years to
over $2 billion today. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize digital and technological innovation to
drive increased direct revenues.

IHG has a long history of leading the industry when it comes to guest reservation and revenue
management technology. Introduced in 1965, Holidex was the industry's first reservation system. In the
early '90s, we developed one of the first automated solutions for looking at future demand patterns to
determine pricing structures. This has evolved into the revenue management systems that we have today.

We have continuously refined our technology over the years and we're now in the process of rolling out
our most recent update, our new Guest Reservation System, which we have developed in conjunction with
Amadeus. GRS will sit together with our enhanced proprietary revenue management system on our new
cloud-based technology platform, IHG Concerto.

IHG Concerto will incorporate a comprehensive set of capabilities into a single seamless hotel
management tool. Its initial functionality is GRS and revenue management, which in the future will be
joined by an entire suite of hotel solutions, including property management, sales and catering and point-
of-sale systems. IHG Concerto is now online in more than 225 hotels worldwide, and we're on track to
complete rollout by the end of 2018 into early 2019. Hotels are already reporting efficiencies from the
modern intuitive interface. On the top right of the screen, you can see the general manager's dashboard,
which lets them better manage their hotel performance.

We have built a strong digital and technology platform across the board in recent years and we're
continuing to innovate, focusing our resources on initiatives that we can scale and which can make the
biggest impact on our owners and guests. We now have mobile checkout live in more than 3,000 hotels
across the U.S. with 90% of guests reporting an improved checkout experience. We're currently looking
at scaling this functionality globally. We were the first global hotel company to sign a global partnership
with Alipay, giving Chinese guests the ability to pay via this method through all of our online and mobile
channels. IHG Connect, our seamless WiFi guest login, is now in place for being installed in over 3,000
hotels in the Americas and we're now preparing for global implementation. This is making a significant
difference to our guests, driving Guest Internet Love up by 5 points.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

Moving now to the proposition we provide for our owners, and IHG has a long history of franchising hotels.
Holiday Inn was the original franchise hotel brand with Kemmons Wilson providing the first hotel franchise
over 60 years ago.

It takes an immense amount of expertise, tools and scale to get franchising right and to ensure that our
owners have the support they need to drive superior guest experiences, revenues and returns. We have
a winning formula and have created what we believe is the best franchising platform in the industry built
around 3 key elements: firstly, high value brands. Owners want household name brands such as ours that
appeal to guests, appeal to lenders and that are easy and cost efficient to build. We provide flexible design
solutions with dedicated design and engineering support and procurement functions heavily involved in
sourcing for build-out.

Secondly, owners want low operational costs. We have an owner-centric support structure, which allows
frequent and insightful communication. We also have intuitive and prescriptive operational support tools,
which help our owners and GMs run their hotel successfully. These include our IHG Marketplace purchasing
platform and our IHG Green Engage online sustainability tool.

Finally, owners want high-quality, low-cost revenue generation. We provide this through our enterprise
delivery system, all the tools I've just talked about, including the loyalty program and distribution
channels.

These 3 elements together provide an end-to-end solution which generates high returns and drives asset
values for our owners. This is an area we have focused on heavily in recent years and which has helped
drive our net system growth from 2% in 2013 to 4% in 2017.

But there's always an opportunity to do more to enhance and expand our owner proposition to unlock
even more growth. We want to deepen the penetration of our brands in the highest value markets, so
we will be investing in more people on the ground in our focus markets to support the expansion of our
brands and in more hotel developers to win more deals with more owners. This will build on the successful
investment we made in the Americas, which helped drive a 10% increase in the number of hotels we
signed in 2017.

We have also identified an opportunity to add in more resources to support owners through the hotel life
cycle. This should help decrease the time taken between generating leads, signing and opening hotels, and
therefore, help accelerate our net rooms growth.

There is also a significant potential for us to expand our franchise offer into new markets and brands. We
launched Franchise Plus for Holiday Inn Express in Greater China in May of 2016 and have since signed
up 74 hotels to the new format, including 54 in 2017. We expect this strong momentum to continue into
2018.

Building on this success, at the end of last year, we announced that we would expand our leading franchise
offer, the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands, in Greater China. We've got 4 -- we've got agreements for
4 hotels to sign up for the full new format to date, including the Holiday Inn Beijing Lido, which was IHG's
first ever hotel in China back in 1984. Over time, this will create significant opportunity for IHG but we are
taking a measured approach working with established strategic partners who have proven track records of
superior hotel management and operations experience.

We're also looking at how we can evolve our operating model and owner proposition for Kimpton. This will
allow us to further accelerate its growth, both within its home U.S. market and globally. We're currently
looking at potential options for this and will have more news on this in due course.

Moving on to our brands. As I touched on earlier, we have evolved the marketing function so that we now
have one comprehensive global approach led by our new Chief Marketing Officer and category leads who
are responsible for the performance of the entire category of brands. We now have one central team that
brings together everything relevant to our brands: positioning, pricing and priorities. This will help us
deliver a more coordinated approach to the marketing and brand development activities, allowing us to
eliminate duplication of effort and create significant efficiencies.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

In recent years, we've developed a strong and differentiated brand portfolio, which appeals to our guests
and owners, and I want to spend a few minutes talking about how we see brands today, and what we're
doing to strengthen them. And then I'll touch on the opportunities we seek to augment our portfolio.

Starting with our mainstream brands, these are at the core of our business, dominated by our Holiday
Inn Brand Family and deliver some $14 billion of annual rooms revenue. Holiday Inn is an iconic brand
built over 60 years. It is the industry leader in full-service mid-scale with over 1,200 open hotels. Our
innovation program to keep our offer relevant to changing guest demands is progressing well.

Our new modern guest room design is in over 75 open and pipeline hotels in the Americas and we're now
scaling this concept for global rollout. Our high impact public space design, Open Lobby, is in 70 European
hotels with almost 80% of the estate in the region already committed to the upgrade. And the response
from guests has been very positive, with a 7-point uplift in Guest Love and a 15% increase in food and
beverage profit in the pilot hotels. We are launching Open Lobby in the Americas in the first quarter of
2018. We're also launching new food and beverage solutions to the brand accompanied by new standards
and training to enhance guest experience and owner returns.

Moving on to Holiday Inn Express, which was launched in 1991 and is now the industry's largest brand,
with 2,600 hotels open and a further 766 in the pipeline, it is a real category killer. I talked at some length
about our new innovations for this brand at our results in August. Our new guest room design is driving
great results across the Americas and Europe, delivering meaningful Guest Love uplifts. Breakfast is a key
differentiator in the limited service space and our new offering provides higher-quality food options at a
better cost for owners. In the U.S., we're planning a complete overhaul of the breakfast offer across the
estate during 2018, and in the U.K., it's now in place across all hotels and driving great results.

The extended stay segment continues to be extremely popular, with double-digit RevPAR growth in
the U.S. over the past 4 years. Guests love the home-from-home positioning and owners love its high
operating margins due to its efficient manning model. We have a strong and growing presence in this
space. We've more than tripled the size of our U.S.-focused Candlewood Suites brand, since we acquired
it in 2004, demonstrating the power of IHG systems and our ability to plug-in new brands and drive their
growth.

2017 marked our best year for opening for Staybridge Suites since 2009 and our international expansion
for this brand is making steady progress. We now have 11 hotels open across our EMEAA region and a
further 14 hotels in the pipeline, including our first in Southeast Asia, which will open in Thailand in 2019.

Looking ahead, in order to drive more growth for both brands we're working on a comprehensive interior
design update, and we'll be investing more marketing dollars to drive even better guest awareness.

Moving on to upscale brands, and Crowne Plaza has a position of strength in our Greater China and EMEAA
regions. The steps we've taken to strengthen the brand in the Americas are yielding strong results. Our
$200 million Accelerate program is driving meaningful improvements in RevPAR and Guest Love, and
we've significantly -- RevPAR index and Guest Love, and we've significantly upweighted our marketing
spend, launching Crowne Plaza's largest multimedia brand campaign in 10 years. But we're not stopping
here. We're now looking to take some of the design innovations that we've originally developed in the U.S.
to other markets globally.

Plaza Workspace, our technology-enabled public spaces designed for solo work and for small groups,
this drives incremental revenue for our owners from previously underutilized hotel space. And after a
successful trial in the Americas, they'll be launched in all regions during 2018. The WorkLife room has
been designed to create a more unique space for guests to work, socialize and rest, all in the same room.
Following a successful pilot in the Americas and Greater China last year, this will be extended across the
globe in 2018.

HUALUXE is a brand close to my heart as I was heavily involved in the 2012 launch when I headed up the
Greater China region. When the brand was developed, 1 element of its proposition was oriented towards
food and beverage culture, which existed at that time in China. The culture has changed significantly in
recent years, so we've taken and had to adapt the brand to ensure it remains competitive and appealing

13

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

to both guests and owners in the future. Therefore, after somewhat of a pause for breath, we're now in a
strong position for which to accelerate growth with 7 hotels opened and 21 in the pipeline. The hotels that
are open are performing strongly, growing revenues 15% year-on-year and the brand has the best Guest
Love scores out of all our hotels in the Greater China region.

EVEN Hotels and Hotel Indigo appeal to guests wanting a more personalized experience. EVEN has also
had a slower start than we would have liked, as owners have taken time to become familiar with the
concept and understand the returns the brand can deliver. But we're now really building on the brand's
credibility with great properties such as our owned hotel in Brooklyn, New York and our managed hotel
in Times Square, which continues to win impressive third-party accolades. We're also gaining momentum
internationally, having launched the brand outside the U.S. in 2017, with our first signing in Auckland,
New Zealand. This is part of a multi-unit agreement with our great partners, Pro Invest, to build 10 or 15
hotels for the brand across Australia and New Zealand. We also signed 3 EVEN hotels in Greater China,
with properties set to open over the next few years in Shanghai, Sanya and Jinan.

Hotel Indigo is going from strength to strength for this local neighborhood positioning, really resonating
with guests and owners. In 2017, the brand saw its highest level of openings in 5 years, including an
iconic property in downtown Los Angeles and our first resort for the brand in Bali. We're also accessing
more prime locations globally with our first signing in Japan and our fourth for London at #1 Leicester
Square, an excellent location, which is due to open in the next few months.

Moving to our luxury category and the world's biggest luxury hotel brand, InterContinental Hotels and
Resorts. We now have almost 200 hotels open and more than 60 in the pipeline. We opened 8 hotels in
2017, including a stunning property in Los Angeles with 72 floors and a rooftop bar. I was there just a
few weeks ago and it really is a flagship for the brand. InterContinental continues to receive industry
accolades, including jumping up 64 places in the Nunwood Customer Experience ranking in the U.S. This
means it's now in third position in between Disney and Amazon, quite an achievement.

We're building on the strong position with a number of initiatives in 2018. These include enhancing our
Club InterContinental experience globally to drive consistency and increased luxury perception and the
continuation of our integrated global campaign, Live the InterContinental Life, which is designed to build a
more emotional connection with our target guest.

Since purchasing Kimpton at the end of 2014, one of our key objectives has been to take the brand global.
We've made some good progress on this in 2017. We opened the doors of our first property for the brand
outside of the Americas in May, the Kimpton De Witt, in Amsterdam. The brand will soon make its debut
in Asia and Greater China with signings in Bali, Shanghai, Sanya and Taiwan in 2017. We're working on
several further deals, which will secure Kimpton's presence in 10 key markets around the world.

We're also working to leverage the benefit of Kimpton's unique offer across IHG's system as a whole. This
is particularly the case for their unrivaled food and beverage expertise, which we're now using to inform
many of our innovations across our other brands. And earlier this year, we completed the integration of
Kimpton's loyalty program, Karma, into IHG Rewards Club, bringing together breadth of hotel options and
redemption possibilities for members of both programs.

I have talked before about the potential to add new brands to broaden and strengthen our portfolio. We
have always done this in a highly-targeted, rigorous and insights-driven way. This includes tapping into
those segments that are both already high in value and have significant potential for growth. We make
sure it's an opportunity that is very attractive for our owners, allowing them to add material supply at
a high level of return. And finally, IHG must have a clear advantage to win in the identified space. We
must be able to deliver superior revenue at price premium. These things together allow us to create the
optimum positioning of a brand to both our owners and our guests. This is the approach we took with our
new avid hotels brand, which I'll talk more about in just a moment. But first, I'm going to touch on the
other opportunities we've identified.

The first is the $40 billion upscale segment, which is expected to grow by 50% over the next 10 years.
Our guest research has highlighted that many consumers are looking for something other than traditional,
big-box upscale hotels; they want a more unique experience. We think there's a real opportunity for an

14

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

upscale brand that offers our guests something more informal and differentiated, combined with the
reassurance and quality standards of a branded chain.

From an owner perspective, they want a brand that can be easily financed and provides a strong return
on investment. They want rapid access to the revenue delivery benefit of IHG's global branded system,
such as access to favorable negotiated rates with OTAs, strong direct channel contribution, access to IHG
Rewards Club, a leading marketing capability and strong business-to-business sales platform.

So later this year, we'll be launching an upscale conversion brand that ticks all of those boxes. This will
offer a new guest proposition, which delivers a strong visual identity through a focused set of high-value
brand standards, which, from an owner's perspective, requires a limited upfront capital outlay and are
efficient to operate.

The rollout will be led from our EMEAA region where we know there are a number of independent hotels
and those belong to small brands, which would benefit significantly from coming into the IHG system.
After initial period, we also plan to extend the brand to our other 2 regions.

The second new opportunity is within the $60 billion global luxury segment, which is expected to grow by
50% over the next 10 years. We see a real opportunity to round out our portfolio and add other luxury
brands at a price point above InterContinental and potentially also in the resort space.

Luxury brands appeal to owners with both existing brands and new build opportunities, looking for a high-
end product that generates profitable returns. A more comprehensive luxury offer will have numerous
halo benefits, including helping us strengthen our loyalty offer and attracting more B2B customers. It will
further strengthen our owner proposition, giving us the ability to deepen our relationship with those who
want to work with us across a broader range of segments and allowing us to fill a portfolio gap that many
of our owners have.

It also gives us the opportunity to build our presence at a higher price point and meet the demands
of high-value consumers, whose needs our current portfolio brands doesn't quite capture. Whilst we
already have considerable expertise in this area, we'll be upweighting our capabilities in the creation of
a new luxury division with a center of excellence, focused on the capabilities needed to win in luxury. By
creating this bespoke and dedicated division, we'll be bringing together some of the most experienced and
respected people in the industry across branding, luxury, operations, design, development and customer
experience.

Collectively, they will help us drive our offer ensuring that our existing luxury brands continue to evolve
and allowing us to rejuvenate any new brands that we acquire in the future. On that point, we are
currently looking to acquire 1 or 2 small, luxury, asset-light brands that we would incubate and grow in
order to access these significant opportunities.

Earlier, I mentioned the launch of avid hotels, which is the most recent addition to our brand portfolio.
Our consumer insight showed that 14 million guests spend $20 billion in annual industry revenues in this
segment in the U.S. alone. These guests are feeling underserved by the existing midscale brands in the
price point below Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express. They are traveling for both business and leisure
and they're looking for consistency, a clean, safe environment and good value. They want the basics done
exceptionally well, at the right price and don't want to feel they're paying for things they don't need.

Avid hotels has been designed to meet those consumer expectations. Our deep insight and our proven
strength in the mainstream segment present owners with a compelling proposition. They will get a
distinctive brand linked into a powerful revenue delivery system with a low-cost operating model and
design engineering that will drive a high return. The brand is targeted at a $95 to $105 rate, which is a
10% to 15% discount to Holiday Inn Express. At this targeted price point, with an appropriate room size,
suitable fixtures and fittings, relevant public spaces and a lean extended-stay style operating model, we
will deliver cash-on-cash returns equal to Holiday Inn Express. In turn, we can justify a royalty rate of 5%.

This is an incredibly enticing proposition for around 2,000 existing Holiday Inn Brand Family franchisees
who are ideal owners for this new brand and who are heavily involved in the key areas of its creation.
The demand for this compelling offer is clear. We only officially launched the brand in September last

year and since then, we've signed 75 hotels into the pipeline, including our first in Canada. We had our
first groundbreak in December. And that hotel is due to open in Q3 of this year. We're also launching the
brand in Mexico and are planning a global launch of the brand at some point in the future. Here are some
renderings what the new brand will look like.

Avid is a perfect example of how, over a short period of time, we identified a unique opportunity, engaged
potential owners, developed a successful concept and brought it to market.

So in summary, we have delivered a strong performance in 2017 and are confident in our ability to
continue to accelerate our growth. The fundamentals for our industry remain strong, and our scale is at
significant competitive advantage. We have the right strategy and we are committed to making our model
work harder.

We are reorganizing the company to create efficiencies, which we will reinvest behind the new strategic
initiatives we've announced today. We are confident that these will deliver industry-leading and highly
profitable net rooms growth over the medium term. This in turn will lead to significant cash generation,
and in line with past practice, we remain committed to returning any surplus funds to our shareholders.
Thank you, and with that, Paul and I will be happy to take your questions. You can ask Paul first.

Question and Answer

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Jamie.

Jamie David William Rollo
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley. Just maybe starting with the position to cut quite a bit of cost and
reinvest that, it's not something your [ others ] or big asset-light peers have done recently. So my
questions are, first, do you think that risks the core business at all in terms of about 10% of your central
costs being cut initially? Secondly, is the additional spend going in, is that a sign of the company, perhaps,
underinvesting, historically, or indeed a sign of greater competition? And then the third and last question
is, are you prepared to give any targets on room openings? I'm thinking probably sort of 6% is the
number you're thinking about in terms of best-in-class. And what's the phasing of that? I think you said
this year will be higher on removals.

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

All right, maybe I'll start on the third one going there. So when we were developing the strategy and
thinking about how we would accelerate our growth, we recognized we wanted to be industry-leading
in terms of net rooms growth. And so today, industry-leading is 5.5% to 6.5%. Now I don't know what
industry-leading will look like in years to come, because I can't forecast the macroeconomic environment,
the financing environment and what will be out there, though, but we believe through the new initiatives
we've identified, we'll be able to continue to accelerate our growth and stay in that leading pack of net
growth going forward. I guess the question is the spend kind of underinvestment. This is effectively just
a reallocation of resources. We've made significant investments over the recent years around technology
and brands and markets. And as the business has matured, we now recognize that we can reallocate those
resources to high-growth areas, too. So it's, literally, we're not taking it up just to drive bottom line profit;
it's to take the cost out and reallocate it against new parts of the business to accelerate growth. So I don't
think it's a reflection of any underspend, whatsoever. And in terms of the quantum of the cost being as a
percentage of the base...

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson
CFO & Executive Director

I guess the way we'd look at it is if you look at what Hilton did when it was under private equity
ownership, there was a lot that they did to the business, obviously, out of the public eye. And actually,
you look at what Marriott did a few years ago, they did take out quite a lot of cost from SG&A and they
put it into their development function, quite a significant amount. And then you look at what happened a
few years on from that in terms of the step-up that they saw in their openings, which is from capturing a
higher share of signings. So it's the right time for us to do it now that we've got various programs like GRS
[ handles ] the market that we're putting in place. All the platforms allow us to now step things up a bit.
So I don't see it as a risk to core competence. We're pretty buttoned up in terms of how we'll do it and it
will take a little while to come through, but it'll be done in a very measured way.

Jamie David William Rollo
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just on the sort of bridge from 4% last year to say 6%, this year sounds like it's going to be towards the
low end of that sort of gap, given the removals are a bit higher. Is that right, and you're not going to get
the full benefit of the costs reinvest until 2020? So if, at the first year, we should expect you to hit the
5.5% to 6.5%, if that's the industry number then.

CFO & Executive Director

Well, it's hard to predict exactly year-on-year and I think we said in 2017 that we wanted to see
progression and I think that the 4% that we've delivered, we were happier with that. As we're heading
towards industry-leading over the medium term, so it's going to take a few years to get there, but I would
still hope to see progression in 2018 towards that number. So I'd hope to do better in 2018 than we did in
2017.

Richard J. Clarke
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Three questions from me, please. The first one is just on the lack of a cash
return. You mentioned, I think in the initial release, you said, the main reason is you're spending this $200
million exceptional cost, but, Paul, you said $120 million -- about $120 million of that will have to be paid
by the system fund rather than IHG. So -- and if you've paid $35 million last year, you've only got $45
million to spend. So it doesn't seem like that should have held you back on doing the cash return. Is this
you holding money back for the M&A you've talked about? Or is there something else going on I'm missing
there? Second question, your guidance seems to be you can continue to grow margin at 135 basis points
a year. You're taking out more central costs, so it doesn't look like you'll be able to drive it from there.
So can you maybe talk about where does margin expansion come from in the regions, if not centrally?
And then the third one, something you didn't touch on, but it's in your release is that you've grown your
credit card sales by 14.5%. If my maths are right, you're getting about $125 million, somewhere about
that, maybe I've got that wrong, of revenue from that. That's going to come on to your income statement
this year. What's the drop-through on that? Will you make a profit on that? Or does that go back into the
system fund in some way?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

On the first one, in terms of the cash return, I mean, when we think about how we invest cash as a
company, fundamentally, it's first to grow the business, then it is to maintain the sustainable dividend and
then returning surplus cash to shareholders. You look at it right now, we're making significant investments
in the business today in multiple areas, one is around technology. So this is a significant year for GRS
in terms of deployment, which is utilizing cash to get that out into the business. We're investing behind
launching new brands like avid. And then there are costs related to the [ exceptional ] piece to it. And so
when you factor those things in and I'll let Paul add some color if needed, when you get down to a smaller
cash return, then it's really just kind of not really worth it to do something that's only a small cash return.
So we want to make sure that when we -- because there's a cost associated with every time we do a cash
return special dividend. So making sure going forward that when we have surplus cash, we'll return to
shareholders but of a sizable nature that makes sense to do it.

And in relation to the system fund, it is a bit complex, that all the system fund accounting and how the
cash gets in the system fund and I'll talk more about it on the 17th of April when we do our teaching
around it, all right. Because it continues to get more complex [indiscernible]. If you think that -- the cash
that's going to be spent by the system fund is still cash that goes out the door and cash is fungible. So
cash is all-cash. So yes, it will go out of the door and it will actually extinguish the vast majority of the
system fund surplus that's built up over time. So you have to sort of think about it in that context. It does
still absorb cash that would otherwise have been available. Look, in terms of M&A and what we might
do there, I mean, we have said that it would be a small acquisition that we're looking at. So it's not war
chesting. It's not holding money back for that. This is genuinely that -- we could have done a small return
instead, but there is some cost in doing every return that we do together with the share consolidation. So
it would be better to wait until it's of a significant magnitude, more significant magnitude and then raise it
then. In terms of your question on guidance, I think we've done a pretty good job over the last 13 years,
on average 135 basis points accretion to margin and there's lots of things that we have done in terms of
using procurement better in terms of zero-based budgeting, in terms of offshoring, outsourcing, et cetera,

and there's more that we can do there even after this program. So we do believe that going forward, post
this, there's still an ability how to drive margin. Part of it is helped by the fact that our business -- in a
franchising environment, as you're bringing more revenue, you don't actually a lot more cost that comes
in, so there's natural margin accretion that comes in there together with the very strong discipline we
have around costs. And in terms of credit cards, you're the expert at that, Keith.

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Yes, I mean, so clearly, we're continuing to grow and accelerate the credit card offer that we have with the
co-brand and looking to expand that co-brand offer going forward. Then that benefit that just flows into
the system fund and so that gives us increased marketing capacity. So we've had great results, I expect
that we, I think, doubled the amount of net capacity that credit card creates for us over the last 3 to 5
years, but that will continue to grow, but it stays within the system fund to support royalties, to support
marketing and drive investment there.

Jarrod Castle
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It's Jarrod Castle from UBS. Can you say anything on wage inflation in the U.S., whether it's a positive or
a negative, especially with the tax cut? Secondly, I take it the answer's no, but you're obviously adding
brands to the portfolio. Are there any brands which are under review, which potentially, you're not happy
with? And then just also kind of back to Jamie's question of that. I mean you want to accelerate growth.
How are you going to make sure that the quality of the pipeline is strong, especially if the downturn does
or doesn't come over the next few years?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Again, I'll take those in reverse order. Accelerating our growth, I mean, fundamentally, we've spent the
last decade strengthening the quality of the brands in IHG, and so we want to make sure that as we
continue to accelerate growth, we don't take a step backwards. I mean this not just about short-term
gains; this is about long-term sustainable growth and building high quality brands. So 2 aspects to it, one
is we mentioned we're investing more in owner life cycle, so that how can we take from a lead to signing
to breaking ground to opening being even faster and better managed to ensure high quality hotel, so we'll
be upweighting resources in that space. And the focus of how we're building out the brand standards,
high-quality hotels, great brand experience is core to who we are and we wouldn't put Guest Love up
there every year and talk about the movement in that metric if we weren't committed to building quality
brands. And so that's committed from the board level and the executive all the way through the business,
that's what we do. We're not thinking about exiting any brands. We definitely are going to continue to
round out the brand portfolio over time to strengthen the customer proposition and the owner proposition.
And in terms of inflation in Europe, do you mean in terms of the macroeconomic environment for trading
or...

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

CFO & Executive Director

Yes, I guess, there are positives and negatives, I guess, you could say. For owners, it will come through as
higher costs in the hotel. Equally, a lot of our brands are very -- they're lower labor cost brands. So if you
look at what's driving the very strong demand for say Holiday Inn Express, for avid, for our extended stay
brand, people are looking for lower cost -- lower labor cost opportunities, so it does play to our strengths
there.

Timothy Ramskill
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Tim Ramskill from Crédit Suisse. I've got 3 questions as well, please. Just firstly, in terms of the upscale
conversion brand, I appreciate, there's more to follow on that, but is it fair to assume that the fee
structure on a conversion brand may be a little lower than the average? But also, could you talk about
the speed to market given it's a conversion brand rather than a new build product? Second question, just
coming back to the sort of acceleration of growth and your comments about margins. Given you're aiming
to deliver this improved growth, basically, on the same cost base, is that partly why you expect that
margin enhancement over time, there should be a sort of stronger drop through from new fees from new
rooms? I tend to think we think about gearing on RevPAR but less on space. And then the final question
was just you talked about evolving the proposition for Kimpton. Can you just expand a little bit on what
exactly you mean by that?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. In terms of the conversion brand, when we're thinking about, a, speed to market, it's
going to be a very quick to market, because it's an existing hotel that we'll be converting over to a brand.
So we're not having to break ground and build. So it gives us the opportunity to convert so you would
expect us to be able to see that pipeline be well-established and then grow quickly, with lower times
to convert once they come into the pipeline. So I think that's generally fairly common with that sort of
brand overall, too. In terms of the fee structure, long term, we've been -- maintained a fairly consistent
fee structure across all of our brands because of the value of the system. And so there may be initially
some structures as we're ramping it up, but long term, sustainably, you'd want to see that a fee structure
commensurate with our other brands. I think in margin enhancement, to Paul's point, it's the model,
fundamentally. I mean with a large scale business and a big franchise business, as that gets bigger, you
just get the natural drop through in terms of margin enhancement overall. And then the disciplined cost
management, you look at what we've been able to do in the last 5 years of controlling cost and then
flowing that through to future discipline should cause us to have true confidence in meeting that margin
growth period over time. And in the Kimpton proposition, it's not that we're going internationally, it's
really trying to understand what -- how can that -- how can we accelerate it further both domestically and
internationally. That could look at things like different propositions around Kimpton, spinning off from that,
it could look at do we -- would we consider anything like franchising in the future. So it's really different
owner offers and different models and to figure out how we could -- and we have a very clear vision. It's
an exceptional brand. You've seen great momentum taking place in that right now with the launches now
happening in Asia. It is just how do we -- again, the fundamental premise we have as an executive team
now is leveraging all of our assets which are our brands and how do we accelerate our growth with those,
again in a sustainable way. And so thinking creatively about Kimpton now that we understand it better.
We've had it for a number of years. We understand how -- what the owner offer is, the development offer
is and can kind of tweak that to grow it. I'll just kind of work the room.

Monique Pollard
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Monique Pollard from Citi. Three questions from me. Firstly, on the potential acquisition for small and
luxury brands, could you give a bit more detail and sort of what types of geographies and sizes of brand
could interest you there? Secondly, on U.S. RevPAR, ex the sort of benefit you've seen from hurricane
displacement, could you talk about whether you're seeing any underlying pickup in RevPAR in the oil

20

states? And then finally, again on U.S. RevPAR, have you seen any change in international demand on the
back of the weaker dollar?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

So in terms of acquisition of luxury brands, the way we think about it, there are probably 3 distinct ways
you can build a luxury brand from 0, so you can decide that you're going to build their brand concept and
then buy some assets or -- and that's pretty capital-intensive and slow. The other way is to go out and
buy a very big luxury brand company which wouldn't be consistent with what we've strategically done
over time and so we are very focused on the sweet spot of acquiring an asset-light, small luxury brand
company or companies with a strong customer proposition, strong owner proposition that we can grow.
There are a number of those located throughout the world right now that we've had conversations with
that are interesting, but we recognize that's the way of leveraging the IHG enterprise and it's close to
organically growing a business that you can do in the luxury space. And in terms of geographic, there are
a number of locations, but it will be very, very small and distinctly focused. U.S. RevPAR, I think when
you look at Q4, U.S. RevPAR was at 3% in total. Lots of noise in Q4, though, let's be candid about it. You
still have the impacts of the hurricanes. You have the shifting of the Jewish observance and so forth. So
stripping that, underlying what was the Q4 performance, it was definitely stronger than in Q3 and an
acceleration. And if you look at the second half of the U.S. RevPAR performance, it was 1.7% on a full year
of 1.2%. So you're definitely seeing more momentum in the U.S. in Q4.

Monique Pollard
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Any understanding of the oil states sort of ex the hurricane displacement, whether you're seeing a pick up
there?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Well, that's the challenge with the oil states, because the oil states are actually the hurricane states and
so you're seeing more rigs being spun up. But to the hurricane effect, it is just noisy and so -- but again,
I think whatever the underlying is, the underlying is stronger than it was in Q3 and you're seeing that
momentum, so which is good. And international, I think, generally positive trends, I mean, across most
markets, except Middle East is probably the one market that's still continuing with the restructuring and
the price of oil, but in general, you're seeing positive RevPAR trends in demand.

Angus Vere Tweedie
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Angus Tweedie from Merrill Lynch. Could I just ask on the conversion brands, why are you launching in
Europe first? I don't think that's that typical. And how that's going to fit with Holiday -- sorry, Crowne
Plaza, within the portfolio? And then secondly, on the Concerto launch, just a few comments about yield
optimization. Are there any KPIs you might give us on the first hotels that you've opened it out in?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

When we looked at the conversion brand, well a, we've got the U.S. team is a bit busy with avid at
the moment and seeing that brand take off. It was really about the opportunity. You've got 60% of the
portfolio -- of the market in Europe is unbranded. And so versus the U.S. unbranded, it is 20%. So a
much bigger pool to go fishing in for Europe and also a lot more pricing pressure on distribution costs
in Europe than in the U.S. So it was really -- this is where there's a significant market opportunity to be
able to launch a conversion brand and fine-tune it. Also, I have a team here that actually is entitled to
doing avid hotel, so we have the ability and the bandwidth. It's going to sit adjacent to Crowne Plaza.
We're being very thoughtful with the Crowne Plaza Accelerate program, $200 million going behind that in
the U.S., really strengthening that brand. I mean Crowne Plaza has a very strong position in China going
out through Asia and into Europe. We're strengthening it in the U.S. I want to keep the conversion brand

21

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

focused on Europe right now, getting that proved out, so it can sit alongside Crowne Plaza globally in a
non-cannibalistic way. Concerto, I mean, what have we seen so far in the pilot hotels? We've seen great
satisfaction from the users at the property level, because the user interface is so transformational, the
ease-of-use and so we're seeing definitely uplift in satisfaction, decrease in time to do things. We're seeing
better revenue performance in some hotels. It's still a bit early days to see what's going to happen. And
it will be the whole leveraging of the package, whereas Concerto is a user interface, the packaging and
revenue management and GRS. Just as hotels get more and more used to using it how will that better
drive performance, and candidly, this is version 1. And we're going to be regularly updating GRS with
more and more functionality and that's what's going to drive the real revenue uplifts over time. So this is
the foundational piece and then more to come.

Timothy William Barrett
Numis Securities Limited, Research Division

Tim Barrett from Numis. Just a quick question, a broad question about owners and franchisees, how
they're feeling at this point in the cycle. And do you expect most of the accelerated growth to come from
basically people you already know, expanding their businesses?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

Well, we'll use avid as case in point. So we had a record year for signing for Holiday Inn Express
whilst signing 75 avid hotels. So I think that proved our point that there was going to be little to 0
cannibalization between those 2 brands. And the 75 hotels were signed with existing Holiday Inn, Holiday
Inn Express and Staybridge and Candlewood Suites owners. So they had a demand, and it's because of
the way we thought about designing that product. It works on a different footprint in terms of land and
different cost per key, so it's really accretive. And so we think fundamentally -- and that space will come
from existing owners because they have that. Similarly, we're seeing and having conversations about the
conversion brand opportunity, we've been already speaking to owners and they are existing owners. They
want to do something with us where we haven't had a brand. And that's the thing about leveraging our
scale of our ownership base is when we come up with a new product, we have the ability to kind of deploy
it against all those different owner customer segments as well, too. So I would think a significant portion
of our growth could come from -- or will come from existing owners. And so we'll go up and then come
back.

Sophie Aldrich

Sophie Aldrich from Aberdeen Standard Investments. Just a quick question on acquisitions. Aside from the
current focus of 1 or 2 much more luxury brands, could you elaborate on your acquisition strategy more
generally on financing preferences and how is it for your leverage target priority?

Keith Barr
CEO & Director

I mean, the way we thought about this business over an extended period of time in our strategy, I think
we've been consistent, and if not, a broken record about it. And that the fastest way to grow this business
in an asset-light strategy is through by developing organic brands. And we recognize that plays to our
strength, and then it will also be potentially acquiring companies that fill white spaces that are aligned
with overall view on how to leverage and use the balance sheet. Right now out there, how would you say
asset prices are right now, Paul?

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson
CFO & Executive Director

Yes, it's very high.

22

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2018

Yes, I mean right now, multiples are significantly high, at this point in the cycle, so we're focusing on
using our capacity to invest in ones with the highest growth areas that are aligned to creating value for
our shareholders. And so, I mean, we look to acquire small company in luxury. Because we can do that
in a very, very thoughtful way. But again, we're very focused on leveraging the core of this business to
grow and not feeling that we have to do major acquisition to achieve that. Have we got the last question
because we have to run? Give me -- I'm sorry.

Jeffrey Robert Harwood
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Jeffrey Harwood from Stifel. Two questions. First of all, there's obviously a lot of new initiatives discussed
this morning. How far up the to-do list is an acquisition of a luxury hotel group? Because it seems to me
that, that probably presents the highest risk. And secondly, looking at the dividend policy, how should we
view the disconnect between EPS growth and the dividend growth this morning?

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson
CFO & Executive Director

In terms of the to-do list, yes, there is quite a lot that we're saying that we're doing. And -- but they are
different teams that have been working on it. And as you can imagine, we've been thinking about how
do we expand further into the luxury space for a while. We are the largest -- we have the largest luxury
brand in the industry with InterContinental already where we have a great deal of capacity. We have a lot
of owners who want to do more with us. So I wouldn't characterize it actually as a high risk. And I think
it's when you go into something you don't know about, that tends to be higher risk. This is an absolute
sweet spot of IHG, just we need another brand in the space. I think we've demonstrated with avid. In
the mainstream we're already the leader there. We have another brand that's coming in and it's roared
away. I think that when we bring in another brand there, there'll be an awful lot of demand there. So we
are looking for the right thing at the right price to bring in that we can then incubate probably, as Keith
said, small, but then we can grow out from there. And it's absolutely one of our key priorities that we've
talked about. But it will need to be the right thing. In terms of the dividend policy, when you look at the
underlying growth in the earnings of the business, I think you need to strip out the impact on earnings per
share of the share consolidation, which has reduced the share count by 9% over a period of time. That's
coming into this. So I would look more at the growth in EBIT compared to the dividend growth. And then
I think you'll see that's much more in line, and it's in line with what we've done over the last 13 years, I
think. The dividend policy hasn't changed. Thanks, Jeff.

Keith Barr
CEO & Director
Thanks, everyone. We have to wrap up now. So appreciate your time.
