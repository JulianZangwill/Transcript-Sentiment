GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Presentation

Paul Smith
Former Head of Investor Relations

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Glencore's Preliminary Results for 2017. The format
this morning will be, as usual, presentation by Ivan and Steve, and then followed immediately afterwards
by questions and answers.

So with that, over to Ivan.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Okay. Okay, good morning. Thank you for coming this morning, and we're pleased to announce a pretty
good set of results. And as you can see, it's the strongest results Glencore has produced, I think, since its
inception, definitely since we've been a public company.

You can see the adjusted EBITDA of the group is $14.8 billion, which is up 44%; and adjusted EBIT is $8.6
billion, up 118% from 2016. Net income is $5.8 billion, which is up 319%. Funds from operation, $11.6
billion, up 49%. And we're pleased that we will recommend a dividend for 2018, a distribution of $2.9
billion, which is $0.20 per share payable in 2 tranches in May and September.

Marketing. Once again, the [ crux period ], a differentiation of Glencore, performs very well again. And
as we always said, at higher commodity prices, we're more towards the top end of the range. We always
guide between $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion on the Marketing. And when markets are tighter, commodity
price is higher, we're up towards the top end of the range. And as you can see, we got an EBIT of $3
billion, which is up 3% from 2016. And like-for-like, because of adjustment for the ag business because
we only account for 50% of the ag business during 2017 as opposed to 2016, is already 10% up.

Strong performance across the board on the metals and minerals and the energy product business on the
trading, up 28% and 9%, respectively. And as I said, the agri business was broadly consistent on a like-
for-like basis in difficult market conditions. And as you can see, against our competitors who have had
difficult years, the ag business performed very well.

Strong point of Glencore is a strong unit cost, and our margin performance has naturally boosted the
Industrial earnings, and Industrial EBITDA is up 60% to $11.5 billion. Our mine unit cost and margins
are generally better than the previous year. And as you can see, our cost of production across the board
on our various commodities is really at the low end of our competitors, et cetera. Really, Tier 1 assets
performing very well on the cost side of the curve. And post credits, our copper is $0.87 per pound; zinc,
negative $0.16 per pound; post credits, $0.10 per pound; ex the credit, nickel $0.191; and coal, we're
realizing $32 margins. So exceptionally strong on the cost performance across the board, which once
again proves we really have Tier 1 assets low cost and long reserves.

Naturally, there were some emerging inflationary pressures and ForEx impacts across the board on the
costs. However, we're fortunate these were more than offset by the higher by-product credits, which
we're getting on the various commodities that we produce, and that has counteracted the inflationary cost
pressure, which all miners are seeing across the board.

As we've always said, Glencore has a conviction to create value through partnerships, M&A and organic
reinvestment. We're not sitting on our hands if opportunities present themselves. We always will react.
And if they make sense and they fit our business model, we'll look at them, but we do have strong criteria,
investment criteria, whether we do go ahead with them.

We've created conservative financial policies which underpin our balance sheet strength today and -- but
also given us flexibility. And as you are aware, our net debt is now down at $10.7 billion. And we have set
a range, we'd like the debt to stay within the $10 billion to $16 billion range. Even though we want to keep
it 2:1 net debt maximum to EBITDA ratio, we will still want to keep it within that $10 billion to $16 billion

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

range, so it keeps it capped. Even if the EBITDA goes up, we will still not allow the debt to go above $16
billion.

If you just look historically, what we did during the year and improved opportunities presented themselves
to us, and we invested $1.6 billion in capital-efficient growth. You saw we bought the Volcan stake, we
bought the Mutanda stake. But along the way, we also did other partnership-type transactions. And that's
a strength of Glencore because of our relationships across the board, our strong trading activities and our
relationship with various parties around the board, we were able to do this type of partnership where we
don't give up the entire asset. We form partnerships.

We did the Trevali transaction where we merged our assets into Trevali, and we still hold a 25% stake and
we have the marketing rights. We did the oil storage business with HNA, which is now HG Storage, and
we own 49%, they own 51%. But we still utilize their storage tanks and we have the benefit of that. And
we have a strong partner for future growth in those businesses. We formed BaseCore, our royalty stream
business with Ontario Teachers, and we'll use that as another vehicle where we can grow our business.

So we'll continue to look at these partnership-type operations, where we can grow our business together
with partners and we can utilize the strength of them. We did in agricultural business the year before,
we formed a joint venture with the 2 Canadian pension funds, and we use that as a vehicle to grow our
business. So this is the strength of Glencore where we can form these type partnership opportunities to
grow. Expansionary CapEx was $1 billion with a total CapEx of $4.2 billion.

Safety, once again, an important feature of Glencore. We do employ 146,000 employees, so we have a
large amount of employees as opposed to our peers. We do operate in difficult areas around the world and
what we call our focus areas, where we really got to change the culture in those particular regions. And
we did unfortunately have 9 fatalities during the year. That's a big improvement since 2016 where we had
16 fatalities. But we -- it's the first year without a multiple fatality incident. We continue work in this area.
The one area we did have a lot of success is African copper, where we only had 1 fatality in 2017, which is
the lowest in history in one of these focus asset regions. And this is where we have spent a lot of work. It
seems that we are achieving success there, but we still have a long way to go having 9 fatalities through
the group.

So that gives you an idea where we sit overall, our position of the company, and Steve will take you
through more financial details. Thanks.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Ivan. Good morning, good evening to those that are on the webcast or on the call as well. And
I'd like to take you through Glencore's financial performance for 2017 as well as provide some forward
illustrative guidance in respect to volume, costs and EBITDA generation in the business as well. All these
points on the financial highlights page are otherwise addressed on the pages to come, so not going to
dwell too much.

In terms of that improving momentum and trajectory in Glencore, the $14.8 billion of EBITDA, it's quite
interesting just to look at it in the 2 halves as well as we had during the year. So the first half of 2017
was $6.7 billion, second half already was $8.1 billion of that $14.8 billion. So you can already see that
trajectory in terms of margins, in terms of volumes, in terms of marketing performance, we're on the right
track. And as we look forward, particularly on the Industrial side, we'll sort of show you what the capability
of this business is from obviously '18 and beyond.

If we move on to the next page, as Ivan mentioned, Marketing is starting to continuously hit its straps.
It's done it over the last sort of couple of years. It's been a while since we've had a 3 in front of that
number as well as the EBIT side, notwithstanding that we sold 50% of the agricultural business effective 1
December 2016.

So the sort of product's [ facing ] 3%, we just converted it and also like-for-like to show you that there's
been underlying, at least in the metals and the energy side, we've seen some decent growth. But like-for-

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

like, had we still had 100% of agricultural this year, if you just double the $192 million, you would have
seen a 10% improvement year-on-year there.

Metals and minerals, as you can see, continues to be the engine room with sort of $2 billion. That
does reflect the fact that -- underlying that sort of engine is many different facets and many different
businesses and many different commodities. You've got very big-scale global franchises within that
business across copper, across zinc, across aluminum, across nickel, increasingly iron ore, you've got the
cobalt, you've got ferroalloys, you've got manganese. There's many facets of that particular business,
some of which have been sort of contradicting at levels not seen in recent periods of time. So good
performances generally across the board.

Energy, also solid performances across both coal and oil, with meaningful contributions in that close to $1
billion performance. Pleasingly, we've seen some volume kickers come through, having been a little bit
more slow in terms of volume growth inasmuch as the market itself was sort of slow, our own suspension
and curtailment of some facilities in zinc and copper, which we did through '15 and '16, ferroalloys, [ slow
planks ], some of those things, to some extent. This year, if you look through the marketing attributes,
you can see some good volume growth: copper, 14% up; zinc, 40% up; ferroalloys, 14%; and on the
crude oil side, we saw 33% increase. Of course, transactions and partnerships like we had with Rosneft
and the structure with the Qataris that was formed last year, some of the African business development
opportunities that we've had as well across the board is contributing meaningfully on the volume side
within oil.

Agricultural side, it's not particularly material in the overall scheme of things, but just to sort of shine a
little bit of a light on it, given the market dynamics and the general challenging environment, at the cash
generation aspects of this business, at an EBITDA level, you actually saw year-on-year improvement. You
can see a 7% there if we just double up 2016 to 2015. There was additional depreciation this year. So
at the EBIT level, you can see that contraction of 26% because as part of the accounting for that 50%
retention of that stake we had in December 2016, we effectively had to remeasure the historical base
of the business to the same entry price that the Canadians bought in that business. So we have got an
artificial extra depreciation charge noncash that's coming through like-for-like in the Marketing side. That's
just a feature, a little bit of a weight that the business is going to bear relative to its historical costs. But
on an EBITDA level, we've actually seen a 7%, which is quite pleasing in the context of that business as
well.

If we look then at the Marketing, just another page on it. You've seen that sort of $3 billion. We're
maintaining the guidance, $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion, that is supposed to be an all-season guidance range.
As we sit now in 2017, you would sort of -- there'd be an instinct to say we'll chop off the bottom and
increase the bottom, but it is supposed to be there for all seasons. Memories are still fresh in terms of
cycles that can happen in this industry. $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion, we're suggesting that based on current
conditions, we should certainly be towards the upper end of that range as we look in 2018.

And we've always pointed to a few factors that would get us to and that would lend support to that
upper end of that range, all of which we can now put a tick next to those factors. We've said production
volume growth, we've seen that come through, as I've said on the previous slide; tighter physical market
conditions, we've seen that in many commodities; deployment of additional working capital, I'll show you
a little bit of a slide and talk a little about RMI and higher interest rates, which is starting to come through
in terms of some tightening cycles. All of that is factoring into attributes that will take us more towards the
upper end.

And this is a business that has consistently produced very high returns on equity, continues to do so,
notwithstanding sort of discussions and debates around at some point barriers to entry, when do people
want to come and grab that sort of -- I think we've created quite a unique franchise around high barriers
to entry and ability to generate consistently high returns on equity in that business.

If we just turn over to the Industrial side. As Ivan said, we're up 60% to $11.5 billion. We'll look at some
cost and production numbers on the next few slides as well. As you would expect, given the scale and
franchises we have, particularly in coal and some of the bigger metal businesses, that's where we've seen
increases on that particular side. So clearly, higher commodity prices is the primary driver. There's no

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

denying that clearly, there's that leverage to that business because, of course, higher prices is going to
have you -- what you take in one hand, you're going to give away a little bit on the other hand through
some inflation as those very high commodity prices themselves are feeding through into some of your
input costs. And we are a big consumer and procurer of the likes of diesel and explosives, and general CPI
is going to work its way through the system, cost of construction materials, steel, developing projects, if
you like as well.

So that's the nature on the way down. We sort of say, while you're getting some sort of relief from lower
cost inputs, now you're seeing some of that sort of stuff. But we'd still categorize it as fairly modest, as
not particularly tight, as not something that is overly material in terms of the business. And we'll talk
about that cost trajectory as we go through as well.

Very strong EBITDA margins. We [ followed ] the 38%, that's a blend across the metals and mining
business. Of course, there's highs and lows, depending on the structure of those markets. We've got
copper and zinc at higher levels. I think ferroalloys and nickel might be slightly low, which brings the
blend to 38%. And of course, prices has had a big factor. You can see on the waterfall chart, $6.3 billion
of pricing variance that is made up in the copper/cobalt, which is where that commodity that more
than doubled this year is manifested in terms of results, that was $1.9 billion; zinc, $1.1 billion of price
variance; nickel, $0.3 billion; ferroalloys, $0.4 billion; coal, $2.5 billion; and other, $0.1 billion; so $6.3
billion is clearly the big factor that's gone into those.

As we'll work through some of the numbers on the next chapter on that graph on the top right, we would
expect to be here through August and hopefully, in 12 months' time, on spot illustrative 2018 prices
towards the end of January. And volume guidance, we're showing $16.8 billion of industrial EBITDA for
2018 on an illustrative sense. That would be another 46% potential tick-up based on spot price at the
moment and the volume guidance, which we'll talk about a little bit on the next page.

The Industrial bridge, there were some negative factors, of course, on volume and cost volume, we -- it
was primarily copper and coal, 8% down in copper. Factors that have been well-reported on and discussed
during the ongoing production performance. We saw lower production through consumable and power
available in Africa; Mutanda and Mopani, a little bit as well; Antapaccay, a little bit slower on that side;
and coal, down 3%, primarily due to weather and strike-related actions. So that clearly is going to have
a volume impact and the associated cost impacts. But you can see on a unit performance, it's still being
very solid as we work our way through the system.

If we then look at what our cost trajectory -- I think, Paul, if you can just go to Page 21, I think it's
important to just look at volume, which is clearly a driver of that. It's in the appendix. But I think it's
important not just to -- just to focus for a minute as well. Nothing has changed here in terms of volume
and production guidance we gave at the investor update back in December last year. So the near-term
volume pickup, which is going to have a factor in terms of both performance, EBITDA and value, is in near
term, we've got copper, 1.31 up to 1.465, that's up 12% volume growth, primarily due to Katanga now
coming on line with its first train; 150,000 tonne copper, 11,000 tonnes cobalt; performance is going --
there's been a successful commissioning down there.

We've also got material volume growth in cobalt, clearly, up 42% this year; 27% to 39%, given the pricing
environment there, that's quite a material catalyst; that's primarily Katanga, 11,000, a little bit over at
Mutanda and some of the other operations as well. And coal itself, if we look second from the bottom, up
around 11%, from 120 to 134. You've got HVO that's baked in there, 49% share, which would be between
7 million and 8 million tonnes on an annualized basis. We're assuming we're going to get about 9 months
or so of that coming in, plus the restoring of normal operations post summer weather and strike-related
actions during the course of 2017.

Longer term, which will also feature into some of the modeling and thinking, so you've got more the 2017
to 2020 production outlook at the bottom right, you can see copper, 25%; cobalt, 133%; zinc, 19%; lead,
25%; nickel, 30%; ferrochrome, 6%; coal, 14%; and oil, 39%. So quite material volume growth across all
the commodities. We went through this back in December. I'm not going to repeat it. But you can see the
projects, and we did spend a bit of time on some of the projects, and we got a page on each of those to
do with Zhairem in Kazakhstan, the [ iron ore ] on the nickel side, of course, the African business as well.

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

So if we then jump back to the unit cost, which is clearly a factor as well. You can see some improvements
generally in mine cost and margins across the businesses from '16 to '17 and continuing on through
2018. Some of that, inflationary pressure; some of which, which is passive, I would regard as sort of good
inflation because it's really getting offset through the price, and that's a function of just the CPI impact,
the weaker U.S. dollar on the currencies that's coming through some of the diesel and fuel costs that's
coming through. Nothing we can do about that. That's a factor. It's as good as we run the businesses, and
it's good efficiency drivers. If you do, you're going to have that coming through. But as I said, you sort of
get 3 in one hand and pay out 1 in the other hand.

So copper, we're sort of -- we were flat unit costs. This is, as we've discussed, is a feature of Glencore's
building blocks that we've given out the last few years. These are fully loaded, fully baked-in numbers
from which to sort of mathematically calculate the volume tonnes price expectations you have for a full
EBITDA. So it captures all the cash costs, all the ancillaries, all the royalties, all the freight costs, the
TCRCs, the smelting businesses that we have within the business as well.

So copper is -- was sort of steady year-on-year, clearly helped us. Some of the byproducts both in zinc
and cobalt, we've seen quite a material downshift from $0.87 to $0.80. Katanga, of course, through
volume and others, is a factor; byproducts is helping there. The only change we've done relative to
December is that now Katanga, Mopani are part of this all-in unit cost blended calculation at the 1.5
million tonnes or so we dug. We previously had it excluding those, given their ramp-up phase, and we had
a placeholder, I think, of around 500 million, but that's fully in those numbers as well.

The coal, the other big part of the business, now bases some Newcastle benchmarks pricing at the end
of January. And our mix, we're looking at around a 37% margin there. You've got some cost increases.
But again, it's really passive coming through, through royalty-related increases, which is based on the
price itself. So that's just a flow-through as you add that to the prices as well. We should -- could maybe
separately itemize them in the future as well just to show the linkage against that.

You've got the higher diesel costs, you've got the currency movements. Clearly, there, you've seen quite
big strength in rand, which is sort of a double-edged sword there. It's good in terms of what's happening
down in the country, but the strength of the rand is clearly having a material impact down there in
a market where it's not necessarily the price set like it is in ferrochrome. You'd expect ferrochrome
potentially to be able to pass that additional cost benefit.

So on nickel, also improving through byproducts and some increased volumes, which we'll see coming
through in 2018. And zinc continues to power along, byproducts is a big factor there; lead and the various
precious metal streams as well.

So if we look at actuals and then later on, on the slide, you'll see [ later ] the spot generation using those
volumes, you'll see a big shift. We've got copper, $4.4 billion was the EBITDA of Industrial 2017, going to
$7.1 billion illustratively 2018; zinc goes $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion; nickel, $0.6 billion to $1 billion, which
is a nice movement and starting to present itself in a more positive light; and coal, $3.9 billion up to about
$5 billion as well.

If we look on the next page, just to highlight the CapEx, nothing new beyond what was said at the
investor update in December last year. We're looking at a $4.5 billion average CapEx 2018 to 2020 to
deliver the sustained business and that growth that we were talking about on the previous slides. That
was lifted up from the previous, about $4 billion, we gave the reasons back in December and highlighted
the various projects that were part of that particular project. 2017 CapEx on the Industrial side was $4
billion, which is bang in line with where we've been guiding throughout the year. So nothing to add there,
unchanged from the December.

Obviously, from a financial perspective, a nice slide to look at. And presiding over, my day job is getting
very easy in this company, as you can see, very conservative capital structure, high liquidity levels,
manageable maturity profiles, no debt maturing in terms of maturities more than about $3 billion. The
shape of net funding and net debt from where it peaked in about 2013, '14, to where it is at the moment,
we maintain our financial policies around commitment to strong BBB, Baa. I think we're on target with
these metrics to get there. S&P, we're BBB with a positive outlook; Moody's at Baa2. I would suspect these

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

ratios would -- and trajectory and financial policies would be rerunning the numbers in the next month or
so post the thing.

Just to spend a couple of minutes just on RMI. You would have seen that go up the sort of $5 billion. If
you looked at pricing movements during the course of 2017, from the start of the year to the end of the
year, collectively, you would have to come up with a number that says it's not going to stay at '17. We've
got prices in our core commodities. Copper was up 30% during the year, start to finish. Zinc, 30%; cobalt,
130%; aluminum, 32%; nickel, 28%; lead, 24%; oil, about 25%. These are big movements. They all
blend out to anywhere between 25% and 30%. RMI itself was up 30% during the year. So there's a very
strong correlation between pricing and where we ended up the year.

We've attributed and calculated RMI down to -- of that increase of around $5 billion. $3.5 billion would
be passively attributable based on volumes in your core sort of supply chain that are working through the
system at roughly 45 days. If you take the volumes, we even give the volumes in copper and nickel and
everything that we do, take annual volumes, put 45 days or so as an average sort of conversion cycle
across this new time of the movement, you're going to get to a number of sort of around $3.5 billion.

In terms of RMI, that's reflecting the price environment at the end of December. It was around $1.5
billion, which we would attribute to deploying some inventory funding around some attractive risk-
adjusted opportunities that invariably happen in markets also from time to time. Some of the timing
can also equally present themselves during a 31st of December period when you've got the industry
itself is looking to do a little bit of housekeeping and you find some loose tonnes, and there's clearly
an opportunity temporarily to go in there. The returns on equity from a Glencore business in terms of
our core competencies, take that inventory, fund it for a few months and eventually generate some
meaningful EBIT. There was some of this clearly contributing to that good marketing performance, a $3
billion performance we were setting at the beginning of December and still sort of talking towards a $2.8
billion. You've got all these positive effects that were coming, that we're hitting us towards the end of the
year as we ultimately delivered at the $3 billion.

If prices stay where they sort of are at the end of January, driving that $19.7 billion of spot EBITDA, we
were generating about free cash flow towards the $10 billion, there'd be no reason and nor would we allow
RMI to sort of go up from these levels. If anything, I think that's a cyclical cap. If prices go up, copper is
[ $10,000 ], oil is [ $140 ], well, different story, all bets are off, you're going to see that, but our EBITDA
will be $25 billion or so at that stage.

So these are the factors we have out, that's a natural consequence. We've seen the reverse side of that as
we've gone through the last couple of years. A couple of years ago, standing up here saying there's been
a sort of a $5 billion release of working capital by the same factor in those business. So that free cash
flow now is going to flow through. We're at these periods that reflect now the prices of the day. Even as
we look towards -- this was a particular point at the end of December, as we closed at the end of January,
we'd already reduced RMI by about $1.5 billion or so just from that 1 month really as we rolled out some
of these opportunities that were there at the end of the year.

If we go onto the next page, again a slide that would be reasonably familiar, the capital allocation slide
and the cycle, the circle, it's more of a square now, as we've gone, Martin, thanks for squaring it up. 2017,
those factors, Ivan alluded to some of those, we paid out the fixed distribution last year. We did $1.6
billion acquisitions, made up of Mutanda, Volcan and the likes, a bit of Yancoal as well, that was part of
the two-tiered transaction that we did with the purchase of HVO. We've also had to put $300 million into
capital raising that [ they've done ], so we're still the proud holder of about 7% of Yancoal as well, which
is nicely in the money at the moment. And our net debt, $4.8 billion of the free cash flow generation,
aside from those few things we've done, has moved towards debt reduction, getting us down to the lower
end of that $10 billion to $16 billion range.

As I've always said, that would be a trigger getting through $10 billion, would be a trigger or catalyst in
the absence of some other deployment opportunities that may present themselves. But irrespective of
that, the numbers are just going to be big by virtue of applying the $1 billion and 25% of industrial free
cash flow, that would be a catalyst to potentially materially increase the payout ratios beyond what they've
been. And already now, it went from 25% to this 36%, the potential would be to materially increase. And

conceivably, it could be 100% payout ratios. There's no upper limit here in terms of we've seen other
ones, say, 40% to 60%, or no more than 50%, whatever, could be 100%. Let's see how we sort of present
themselves going forward.

So we've got all the equity cash flows, bottom right, $7.7 billion, and it just flows itself around the circle
as we've -- which is translated into those improved graphs around the debt trajectory, debt coverage
ratios. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is now 0.7. It's going to be sort of -- it will be an M soon in terms of being
able to mathematically calculate that ratio. Ivan's probably working out, $20 billion net debt x2, there's a
lot of...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

There's a lot of surplus capital, there's a lot of surplus capital that's currently being generated relative
to financial targets as well. Clearly, there's an opportunity come the interim results in August to look at
a top up of that distribution of the $0.20 we've come up with, given that financial strength and how we
see the world at the moment. But we can take -- so August is always going to be our live date also in
terms of looking at some of those distributions. As a sort of mechanical payout ratio as a percentage of
net income, it's come out at 52%. But at the end of the day, you're paying distributions out of cash flow,
not net income, which is how our approach tends to work, which is mathematically, if you want to look at
that, and some people focus on it, it is a number out there.

Just to close it out here, just to add a little bit of complexity to the team here and how we're looking
at balance sheet and numbers. If we go to the next page, just to show you the Volcan, sort of the
accounting mechanics and the treatment of this particular acquisition. As we said, as Ivan mentioned
on the 9th of November, we were -- there was a tender process for us to secure a decent chunk of the
voting shares, which we had already pre-agreements to almost go beyond the 50% as part of that tender.
This -- the devoting Class A, we move from 21% to 63%. There's a huge nonvoting float within the
Volcan continuing. So with all that, that the voting moving up to 60-odd percent, we still only have an
ultimate economic interest in the business. It moved up from 7.7% to 23%. So it's still a relatively low
economic participation. There's a big free float. It's a public company, as you all know, listed on the Lima
Stock Exchange. It has all the checks and balances. It is not a Glencore entity for purposes of financial
inclusion. They have their own structure that are ring-fenced. They need to fund themselves, and we'll be
a participant for the foreseeable future in a financial sense through some dividends. Not too dissimilar, if
you like, from Century Aluminum, in which we have the 50% stake with an equity accountant from our
own business, and that's where you see it come in the numbers themselves.

By virtue of having moved over the 50% threshold on the voting shares, under IFRS, we've had to
consolidate the business into [ ours ]. And the financial impact, if you just look at that page on the right
there, it has had the effect of having quite a material explosion in a couple areas of the balance sheet as
well. So despite only putting $730-odd million towards the purchase of those shares, we've had to take
in financially under IFRS $4.6 billion of property, plant and equipment, consolidate the whole lot. And you
can see a very big $1.7 billion noncontrolling interest, which reflects the big 77% free float there.

By virtue of the ring-fenced nature and because it was -- I mean, cash flow and EBITDA, there was
nothing that came into Glencore's financials in 2017, we booked a bit of revenue, but EBITDA, net income
was 0. Through the course of 2018, our current intention is, yes, we've got to IFRS consolidate, but we'll
disaggregate that and present this business as if it's an associate. So just picking up our share of the 23%
of that business through the net income, through the cash flows of that business. And you've seen we've
made the adjustment then to the statutory net debt numbers. We've included our -- we would have been
$703 million higher, but we've taken out the $703 million, which is the Volcan net debt that's found its
way onto our balance sheet at the end of December. We're not doing this from any being clever or through
magic. In fact, Volcan's -- it's a zinc business at the moment, and so that's generating a lot of cash. It has

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

$700 million of net debt, so for a while, it's going to continue. If we continue in that vein, this business it's
going to be net debt free in a little while as well.

So as a mathematical translation and contributing to our business, it could be -- it's just not appropriate
for us to be bringing $350 million, $400 million worth of EBITDA into Glencore's business when we've got
this 23% economic ownership. So that's where we're going to be in the foreseeable future. It's obviously a
watching file in terms of whether there's some increases in terms of how the governance actually functions
in that particular company as to whether it starts looking and feeling like a Glencore entity over time. At
the moment, we're clearly integrating. We've got board representation. We're parachuting in people to
help across various financial, technical and operational sides. We would hope that, that adds. It was clearly
a synergy angle to this business and where we can work closely with this company. We have operations
in Peru. We've been a commercial partner with these guys as well. But this again provides all the building
blocks in how we've treated that and how we internally look at this business as well, which is how the
financials are ultimately there to present to everyone.

So with that, we will hand back to Ivan for some closing remarks. Thanks.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve. Okay. Now that we've all had an accounting exercise on Volcan, let's look at the overall
business of Glencore.

As you can see, I think we've got a great commodity mix. It's very compelling going forward. We believe
we're in the right commodities. What we have not determined Tier 1 commodity mix, we just talk about
Tier 1 assets. Now we can talk about Tier 1 commodities, which I believe is very important. We're the
most exposed to mid- or late-cycle commodities, and it's clear that's the area we're moving into. So we're
going into the mid-cycle commodities, copper, zinc, nickel, aluminum; and the late-cycle commodities,
cobalt, thermal coal, agricultural products. We don't have the PGMs and diamonds, but we definitely have
a compelling commodity mix.

And breaking down the different commodities, if we look at where the markets are sitting, et cetera,
copper is clearly is a looming supply challenge. We all know that demand for copper is going to go up,
with some copper market today run about 23 million tonnes, if we get 2%, 3% growth around the world,
depends on what happens in China, but you're talking about another 500,000 tonnes, 600,000 tonnes of
copper is required per year.

If you look at the supply, we all know there's been a massive underinvestment in new mines in copper.
The only new mine that we see coming is in Panama, and that should come on stream. But besides that,
there's been a total underinvestment in new copper mines. We all know the grade declines, which is
occurring around the world. And we know the elevation of strike risks, which will occur in Chile, especially
during this year. So the rest are supply disruptions, but no new supply is very relevant in copper. And if
demand does grow to 500,000 tonnes, it will be an interesting outcome there.

Cobalt is clearly electric vehicle story. We all know the studies that have been done on the growth of
electric vehicles and where it will end up being. We've seen the investments of motor car companies are
making in electric vehicles, and they will need battery supply, so the demand for electric vehicle is strong.
It will require a lot of cobalt. And we all know the geographic -- or geological scarcity of cobalt. You can't
mine pure cobalt, it's not like lithium. It's a byproduct mainly of copper and nickel around the world, and
the bulk of it comes from the DRC. So we know the demand for cobalt and this is an alternative method of
making batteries will be strong, and the supply is relatively constrained.

Zinc, demand is increasing in emerging markets. We know that for galvanizing, and there's been an
underinvestment in new zinc mines. The growth that we were expecting in China did not occur because
of the environmental restrictions taking place at the zinc mines in China. So therefore, the big growth
that people were thinking would come in zinc is not coming. And the demand grows once again. The
commodity, we believe, there are supplier restraints.

11

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Lead. The same applies to lead, with a robust battery and energy story dynamics. And once again, mainly
also a byproduct of the zinc mines, underinvestments, and once again the environmental restrictions
which are occurring in China.

Nickel demand, once again, electric vehicle, batteries, critical alloy -- it's a critical alloy, austenitic stainless
steel growth, et cetera, that's occurring in the year -- in the world. And once again, no new nickel mines
being opened around the world, but -- which we're getting in Indonesia. You -- the pig iron production
that's occurring, nickel pig iron occurring in Indonesia, but it's taking it time and not growing as fast as
people expected, so limited supply coming in nickel.

Sulphides are declining around the world, so therefore, we see it already there's a shortage. We're
reducing the stockpiles around the world. And we believe there's going to be an undersupply once again
during this year. And we're going to have to reduce the stockpiles around the world in order to feed the
demand for nickel that's occurring around in the market. So once again, undersupply there.

Thermal coal. I know that's not a loved commodity, but once again, it is parring the Asian growth and
urbanization which is occurring in the emerging markets. Demand continues to grow in emerging markets.
And once again, underinvestment in supply, you don't see new coal mines being built around the world.
And where you do see the increase of new production of coal, it is occurring in Indonesia. However, in
volume terms, in metric tonnes, it is growing; but in heating value, in fact, there's no growth because
we're getting decline in calorific value being mined from these various mines. And the CV is reducing
considerably. So really, when you see production increase, it's not really heating value increase which the
world needs. So looks very good.

Also, we see what's happening in China where they did restrict demand of coal being produced because of
the pricing. We now have higher prices in China. They put a cap on around about RMB 750 that accounts,
if you work back and do the adjustments on quality, it gets back to Australia around about $100 if they
maintain the RMB 750 in China. So looking pretty strong in thermal coal. And one thing I emphasize,
you've got to remember, there's no new mines being produced around the world, developed, besides
in Indonesia, which is lower heating value. And you do have decline in production because the mines
eventually will come to an end and they have a life of 20, 25 years, and some of them are soon coming to
an end. So we see it in South Africa, we see it in various parts of the world, where you will have reduction
of coal production occurring there.

Okay, looking at the next slide. The business of Glencore, once again, resilient and proven cash-generative
business. I talked about industrial Tier 1 assets and Tier 1 commodities. It's a new term that we've
introduced. We always used to talk about Tier 1 assets, and I believe Tier 1 commodities is important, as I
emphasized on the previous slide. Glencore's diversified by geography and commodity mix, you've seen it.
We are today, and you saw the numbers, Steve showed the production numbers going forward, whereby
copper will grow to 1.6 million tonnes; coal, 134 million tonnes; cobalt, 65,000 tonnes. So really, we are
the major producer of cobalt in the world. Cobalt, zinc, nickel, we may a bit lower down, #3. Thermal coal,
seaborne thermal coal, the largest in the world. So we're really a major producer of what I believe are the
Tier 1 right commodities that the world is going to need going forward.

And as I said before, these commodities have persistent industry supply challenges and robust underlying
demand, which therefore deems well for the company. We have sustainable low costs. You saw the
numbers, where our costs are going. And we're the byproduct creators, so we have low cost -- the lowest
-- I believe the lowest cost in most of those commodities produced in the world. And we have long-life
assets. There was always concerns, we don't have long-life assets and our reserve base is not as long as
people expected. But you can see, we have long-life, low-cost assets and clearly, Tier 1 assets and Tier 1
commodities.

I don't need to talk much more about the Marketing. It's been proven that it is a high return on equity
type business. It's unique. We're one of the few mining companies who have this alongside our production
side business, which assists us in all part of the business. It helps us recognize asset opportunities for
future growth. We know what is happening in the markets, and that gives us a lot of insight. And once
again, it's resilient. And as we said, the $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion EBIT to the business, and that is very

Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

defensive. As you can see in the slide on the right, it's resilient even when commodity prices fall, drop. It
has been resilient and it is not linear to commodity prices.

The big feature, as we said, at today's spot prices on coal, the forward curve, they act more towards the
forward curve on the coal price, we will generate around about $19.7 billion of EBITDA, generate $9.6
billion of free cash. And that's how we look for 2018. [ Post that out to ] 2019, as Steve indicated, with
higher production figures that are occurring in 2019, that will even be higher than that level. So very
cash-generative at current commodity prices and very high EBITDA going forward.

So what is our outlook? I think I've summed up most of it in the discussion. And as I say, leading Tier 1
commodities, once again, we have great assets. And the Tier 1 commodity outlook is underpinned by this
limited supply. We don't see where the supply is coming from. And we believe the demand is there, the
demand in China continues to grow, once the Chinese consume close to 50% of most of the commodities
that we produce. What's happening in the electric vehicle industry, we're the best place for that out of all
the large caps. We get the advantage what's going to happen in electric vehicles with the demand that's
required for them in copper, cobalt and nickel.

Cash-generative unique business model, as I said, Tier 1 Industrial assets, very low-cost producing, long-
term life; Marketing, highly generative; and once again, emphasize how the EBITDA will look during this
year at these current commodity prices and the free cash flow that is going to generate.

We've always said we're able and willing and we wish to grow our business. We're not going to sit on our
hands. We see a lot of opportunities because of the trading side of the business where we know what
everyone -- what's happening in the business, we see what opportunities are around. And when they
do come around, we will react on them. You just got to look last year, Volcan, because of our strong
relationship with the people in Volcan, when the family was ready to sell, we knew about it and we were
able to pounce and take advantage of that situation.

We look at growth. We don't just look at growth for growth's sake. It's got to be cash flow-generative
and we look at cash flow and we will look to grow our business, that's why we are more M&A rather
than building Greenfields. You know my feeling about building new assets and Greenfields. You don't get
the cash flow for a while. And eventually, when you do get it, you may have overspent it and it doesn't
generate the returns you want.

We've always said, we agree we -- I will cut back capacity, we think we're over supplying a market and
we'll do the same on the other side, and we'll reactivate the idle capacity, as you saw we did with our
zinc operations, when we believe it's appropriate. We have a lot of low cost Brownfield options that we
can add to our existing business, bolt-on acquisitions. We always look at different synergies we can have
with next door neighbors, as you saw with Hunter Valley, the opportunity occurred last year to purchase
the Hunter Valley Operations. The main reason to purchase Hunter Valley, we have the mines next door,
we all know about the synergies that exist there. So we're always looking for those opportunities. And if
you look at our track record on investments, it's been pretty good in the past. So we'll continue to look
opportunistically, see what opportunities come out there. There's no big situation to come where we want
to grow just for growth's sake. We wait. If the opportunity presents itself, we will look at it, and provided
that it's cash flow-generative and meets our high hurdle rates that we have within the company, we'll go
forward with it. And as you can see, 2017 was a good example of which opportunities presented itself to
us and we reacted on them. And they're very good cash generative assets we added to the group during
2017.

As Steve mentioned, we have a conservative financial policy today. Optimal net debt, $10 billion to $16
billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA, less than 2x. Steve said, we want to have ourselves rated and he's not
allowing me to have that big dividend, because as you can see, he's put the cap on the net debt at $16
billion. And we'll maintain the dividend type policy, $1 billion on the marketing, a minimum 25% on the
free cash flow from the industrial side of the business. And as you saw, this year, we delivered a 36% free
cash flow. And as Steve says, later on in the year, we'll have a look at the balance sheet, and we'll see
what we do, whether we increase it, or, what type of investment opportunities present themselves.
So I think that gives you a summary how the group operates and how we intend looking at the future,
looking very strong with the right commodities; very low-cost production, as you saw on the cost

Question and Answer

Paul Smith
Former Head of Investor Relations

Carry on to Q&A.

Liam Fitzpatrick
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

It's Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank. Two questions. Firstly, the obvious one on the DRC. Post the
news, can you just give us an update on the situation timeline from here and so on? And also linked to
that, have you seen any reaction from your cobalt customers to that news? And then separately on zinc,
the market is very tight. So far, you've only restarted Lady Loretta. Is the 2018 volume guidance set in
stone? Or is there potential for further restart as we go through the year?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, on the DRC is what you read. It's clear they wanted to change the mining code. We've seen the ideas
that they got in the Mining Code. The industry have got together and believe there should be consultation
with us, the mining industry. It's been sent to the President, from what we hear, I'm not sure, but what
we're hearing, he has not signed it yet. Hopefully, it will be consultation and the mining industry and the
DRC has got together to discuss this with him, and it's the wait-and-see situation, so we don't know much
more than you hear in the press as well. How would the motor vehicle companies feel about it? It's a
concern, I am sure. We haven't heard, but I'm sure they've got to look at it and monitor just like what
we're doing, because it's going to create an investment in the country, of course, if the Code comes in at
the way it's being drafted the way we see it. And yes, that will be a concern that can the world produce
as much cobalt that it's going to need if the belief is that electric vehicles by the year 2030 will be 30% of
the vehicles produced, you'll need a lot of cobalt for that. So what happens in the DRC is going to be very
important going forward. On zinc, Steve...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

I don't think anything into '18 now, Liam, because you've got some lag times on these sort of things as
well. So I think the 2018 is largely baked in with the Lady Loretta restart through the first half of this year.
And we said, what 100,000 tonnes so that sort of features in. Obviously, we sold the African assets to
Trevali, which is why we are net-net flattish, but sort of like-for-like, we would have made about 100,000
or so up and [ to me that's ] also going through some higher zinc areas. So the other areas is really
Peru and some other Australian sort of options that will weigh up as time goes on. So I think, as we get
towards our -- in May we'll do that Q1 production, that could be an opportunity to the extent that there's
any material adjustments, we'd obviously do that. But as we stand at the moment, even we're holding the
zinc production for 17 to 20.

Sergey Donskoy
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Sergey Donskoy, SocGen. Two more questions on DRC, if I may. One, if you could provide some color on
how the ramp-up of Katanga is progressing. And if you could provide any updated cash guidance, cash
cost guidance. And second question on DRC, more generally, there are reports of political situation that's
becoming less stable and some parts of the country are becoming less -- becoming more violent, maybe.
What is the situation around your operations there? Do you see any risk of disruptions because of all this
instability?

Production...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

I mean just in terms of Katanga, it's a separately listed company. So that we're obviously limited to what
we can say beyond their own reporting requirements. They have their -- they'll be reporting their own
full year results with 60-days Canada, so by the end of February they'll have their own results. So you'll
need to go by their latest guidance which is still the 150, 300, 11,000 tonne cobalt this year 34 and being
able to average around that period. They're under the same continuous obligations as anything, so if
there's anything material to update beyond that, they would have done that already. So you can assume
that, that's still the way it is in terms of their cost guidance. Again, we can't give specific cost guidance
beyond what they may give as a standalone entity. But from what numbers are fed up, we've baked in
their cost performance and numbers into our $0.80 as we look into 2000, but we're not able to go into
more granularity on the Katanga entity and so. But in terms of news on the ground?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, news on the ground, you've got to remember, Katanga, we sit down in the Lubumbashi region, it's
right down on the South, close to the Zambian border. We haven't seen disruptions over there. So there's
no -- even when there have been further problems in the Northeast of the country, that's been -- it's
happened there, very little happened down in the Lubumbashi area, so we haven't seen it for the moment.
Now it's clear we cannot talk about the politics or what's going to happen there, so we just got to wait and
see whether the elections take place at the end of the year.

Jason Robert Fairclough
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones for me. First on dividend. So Ivan, last year, you're talking about $20 billion.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, screwed me.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

It was always just a timing issue, that's all.

Jason Robert Fairclough
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It just feels stingy, throw it out.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Talk to my CFO.

Jason Robert Fairclough
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just the other one for me is on marketing. You did 3, 4 acquisitions last year. A lot of those seem to be
designed to feed into marketing. So I'm surprised with Volcan, with the HVO operations that you're not
raising the guidance band on those marketing earnings.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Yes, look, for the dividend, as we said, we already said 2:1 net debt-to-EBITDA, that was where the joke
occurred, where I said the earnings would be -- EBITDA almost probably be $15 billion, the $14 billion,
$15 billion, whatever we said on this. So 2x could have allowed us to pay a $20 billion dividend, there was
the joke. But now we have said we want the debt to run between $10 billion to $16 billion, net debt. We
will still maintain the 2:1 net debt-to-EBITDA, so that gives you an idea. Yes, it could be stingy, because
we will generate $10 billion free cash this year. We'll take the debt down to 0. But then you do have the
dividends and you do have -- we've still got to pay for HVO, potentially, the Chevron assets in South
Africa. So most probably net debt would be down to $5 billion unless we do nothing else. And if you work
on Steve's 16 year, it does give you room, of course. But we've got to sit tight. We will wait and see what
happens in August, what other M&A may or may not occur in the company and then Steve will have to
review the dividend in August, you said.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

Jason, it's also a matter of priorities. I mean we've set our sort of sequence of priorities. Let's get the debt
down to the $10 billion, that's the catalyst to lift it. Let's get the BBB, the strong BBB sort of locked in.
So you could sort of looking after your, obviously, the different sort of constituents of the structure. The
cash is not going anywhere. I think we're as good as stewards of that cash for now in terms of internal
holding on. We've got the opportunity in August then to come back and say the outlook, let's see the cash
flow generation. Let's see the sort of opportunity set as well around what happens, if that's a more benign
environment, which it is, difficult to buy assets today that meet one's return and you do generate that sort
of cash flow, then the top up is, as I said, well and truly alive in the August period. The money is not going
anywhere. We're currently, we're on a free cash flow yield, I don't know, 12.5%, 13%, 14%, whatever
money, I mean the dividend yield is moving to 4%. That gap is now, we've gone through $10 billion, let's
lock in the positioning around the structure. That gap has the potential to significantly narrow. And it's not
a matter of years, this is live in a matter of sort of months.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

We'll know a lot more in August. Well have a look, is our $20 billion real? Is our free cash flow $10
billion real? Do these commodity prices hold? And then we can assess it. Marketing. Why wouldn't we
-- yes, look, let's see, we've got the Volcan, we've got the Hunter Valley, of course they would present
opportunities, especially, Hunter Valley, the blending opportunities, et cetera, with our own tonnes to party
tonnes, et cetera. And we just got to really get to grips with that and see what it does give us, we don't
own it yet. We're just getting to grips with Volcan. And we'll see how it will affect that. I mean, we do
adjust.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I think I mean the key thing is ultimately the scale of business, that would be at the time you sort
of say you've got meaningful depreciation scale of business from 1 point to the next, is that the trigger
then to take a 3 -- sort of a 2.2 up to 3.2? So you're starting to see signs of that scale improving, clearly
in zinc, and we've always had baked in the organic side of the business. These were latent capacity that
we had in Africa or in some of the [ schatten ] zinc, so that was never incremental. But just sort of Volcans
and HVOs and you do Chevrons, and you had some of these things at some point. And let's see where the
agricultural business goes. I'm sure there will be a question on that at some point, so I'm just preempting
that sort of questions going to come at some point. If that business itself sort of changes a bit overtime
and we keep 50%, where do we end up, does it do something, does it do nothing, I mean, obviously
-- we're obviously alive to opportunities here that would be another sort of volume-scale catalyst to
potentially move things up at some particular point in time. But for now, it's still a sensible range, given
cyclicality in this business, but we're pointing towards the delivery in the upper end.

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Sylvain Brunet with Exane BNP Paribas. You talked about the ROE of marketing. In the past, we had the
equity base to work out the numbers. Could you confirm we're talking probably more than 30% ROE as
a guide? The second question on cobalt debottlenecking. Would there be other opportunities to add more
as the one you've announced? Or was that more of a one-off, without requiring more CapEx? And lastly,
perhaps, on the DRC. Of course, a moving situation there, but what would you say is an acceptable --
would be an acceptable outcome for the mining court?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, firstly, the last question, I cannot comment what's acceptable. We've got to get into this negotiation.
If the negotiation takes place, just like what's happening in South Africa where the new President has
agreed that the mining industry will discuss the new code together with the Minister of Mines, I hope the
same occurs in the DRC. And if it does happen, all of us as a group we'll get together with the Mining
Minister and try find a resolution. Exactly what that is naturally, I cannot say today. And that's what we
would all accept, we would have to get together and see what is reasonable to adjust. And if we do want
to adjust, because we do have an agreement in place already. The other question, I think, was to you on
the ROE, Steve, [ I can't ]...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

30% plus, we haven't given a specific number on that. But you can -- I mean, you can see the sort of
the marketing working capital and we've sort of historically had your 80%, 20% type we've shown on the
dividend sheet at the back around the sort of earnings that sort of come from that. So certainly 30% plus
comfortably on the marketing ROE this year.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

And on the cobalt, I think, what we set out and the growth of the cobalt taken to 65,000 tonnes was the
figure. I think that's about it. I wouldn't expect that to expand much more.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

Within our existing footprint.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, within our existing, if we buy something or something like that happens, that's different.

Menno Gerard Cornelis Sanderse
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

It's Menno at Morgan Stanley. Three short ones. First you've surveyed the field out there, you see clearly
no Greenfield, as you pointed out, but quite a bit of Brownfield, including your own. Is it starting to
concern you a little bit in terms of the momentum that is all those Brownfield expansions are creating? So
not only your own but also the others. Secondly, do you think as a company you are now too big in certain
commodities to take a next step in terms of all M&A? Or do you think given the growth in the markets
since the Xstrata deal, you now have sufficient room to act in all of those? And finally, on China, clearly
environmental measures you mentioned a couple of times, they must have some positive outcomes also
for your smelter fleet in the Rest of the World as they start clamping down. Is that business under earning
at the moment within Glencore? Is there a big earning opportunities from these smelters going forward?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

The smelters are doing well. They definitely -- with China -- with the CapEx in China, certainly smelting in
the West is not as bad as it used to be. So smelting is good. We also...

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

TC/RCs are so tight and others [ at the moment ].

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, they're still tight TC/RCs, but the smelters give us good trading opportunities also and that's why
we like the smelters having that advantage there. But going forward, let's see what happens with the
shutdowns and how many smelters do really shut down in China. And let's see what happens in the TC/
RCs going forward. The other one, are we too big in certain commodities that could we grow -- sorry,
let's just go to your Brownfield story. Yes, we have some Brownfield opportunities, not -- they're good.
We were not going to bring them on, unless, as we say, we will always look at the markets, we don't
want to be the one to bring on capacity and push down markets. So we'll be conservative and ascertain
when is the right time to bring them on. I wouldn't -- I don't believe the industry has massive Brownfield
opportunities, I don't know where you see them, Menno. If you look at cobalt, they definitely don't have
them. And if you look at copper, I don't know where it is, as well as, zinc no one has them. So there's
not many Brownfield opportunities in these commodities. Of course, there are Brownfield opportunities
in some of the other commodities, we see it in iron ore, et cetera. But I don't see those Brownfield
opportunities that you talk about in these commodities. And that's what I'm saying, in most of these
commodities there is limited supply. Yes, the third part of the question...

Menno Gerard Cornelis Sanderse
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Your own size, because the Xstrata deal somewhat big, are you now [ full ] enough to do [ other ones ]?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

We've always said, we will look opportunistically and ensure what happened in 2017, opportunities
presented themselves to us. Now if you had told me this that the beginning of the year in 2017, would
those opportunities come, were they there, we don't know. The opportunity occurred was Volcan because
of our relationship with the family, et cetera, that came. Yes, Hunter Valley, I can't remember exactly
when we did the deal. But yes, we're trying to do the deal, but it wasn't certain, we do it. We did a deal
with the Chinese, eventually, after they were the winning bidder. So that opportunity came. Chevron
opportunity came, you didn't know. So I don't know what's going to come going forward. Are we too big
in certain commodities? What's big? As long as you don't have antitrust problems, there are certain mines
where you can't grow because of antitrust. And then we'd have to assess it and see where the difficulties
would occur. When we did buy Xstrata because of antitrust, the Chinese did -- we did have to dispose of
Las Bambas...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

And Nyrstar at the time.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

And the same with Nyrstar, when we had to give up certain amounts there. So yes, it could happen. But
let's see. You've got to remember, copper we're still 1.6 million tonnes in a 23 million tonnes market.
We've got, I think, we have room to grow, put it that way.

Myles Allsop
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Myles Allsop, UBS. A couple of questions. First of all, could you talk about your ambitions in the agri
space? So you're still as keen as ever to grow in the U.S. area? Obviously, there's some moving parts

Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

19

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

there. And second, maybe going back to DRC, because no one seems to ask [ the question ] but what's
your relationship with Gecamines like at the moment and this contract review, is that something we should
be concerned about? And what comeback do you have if they do implement a new mining code as it is? Do
you have to go through to the courts? Or what's plan B for you guys?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, yes, in the DRC, what is our relationship with Gecamines, it's a partner in Katanga. As you're aware,
they still own 30% of Katanga.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

25%.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

25%, sorry, 25% of Katanga. Still we are talking to them on the recapitalization. So we'll see where that
gets to. We cannot comment much more than that. I mean, you saw on the Katanga board, not much
more we can say about that. It is a separate company, as Steve said earlier. What can we do? Yes, you
do have the process, go to the courts. Yes, we do have agreements in place and if the new mining code
changes the existing agreement which is in place, there is an opportunity to go to court. Hopefully, we
won't have to go there and I hope we will find a resolution. Now, this is similar to what happened in
Australia with the mineral resource tax, which came in place. The mining industry got together and we
eventually did have a discussion with the government and there was a solution for it. So I'm hoping that
the same will occur here. But as you say, I cannot give you guarantees and we'll see where it ends up.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

And ambitions in ag [ business ].

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Ambitions in ag, sorry I forgot that, trying to avoid that one. Ambitions in ag, we did set up ag business
with the joint venture partners with the 2 Canadian pension funds. The idea is to grow that business
and we continue look at opportunities. We have clearly said, we would like to grow in the states. But as
we said earlier, it's not growth for growth's sake. It's going to make economic sense. The ag business is
in a poor state. It does need consolidation. We'd like to be part of that consolidation. And we'll wait for
opportunities, like the rest of our business, if and when they come.

Alon Olsha
Macquarie Research

Alon Olsha, Macquarie. Just 3 questions, 2 related to costs. Cost inflation, obviously, establishing itself
as a big theme now for those part of the cycle, certainly with your peers. Could you highlight areas
in the business where you're feeling, I guess, the most acute cost pressures, what you're monitoring
most closely. And just the second part of that question is, could you provide some of the assumptions
underlying your cost guidance around some of the key byproduct prices and currencies? And then the third
question is just on South Africa. New political dispensation there that's emerged, potentially very positive,
still early days, but are you thinking potentially differently about South Africa? If things do develop in a
positive direction, could you see yourselves reinvesting back in the country?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Steve can talk about cost. I'll take the first part of the question, South Africa. Yes, it is positive. It looks
we are all sitting positive with Cyril Ramaphosa coming in as the President. It should be good for the

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

20

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

country. Unfortunately, it's going to affect your cost because the rand has got stronger. So it has this
win or -- win/loss on each side, but that is good for the country. So it does bode well for the country
going forward. And so yes, we're happy to invest in South Africa. Even under the old regime, we still
continue to believe South Africa would be okay as an investment opportunity. We did Chevron still under
the old regime, so we've always happy to continue investing in South Africa. Of course, now you get
more confident about the future with the new President. But we never pulled back out of South Africa and
we continue to have big investments there with our coal, with our ferroalloys business over there and,
hopefully, with oil refinery there and distribution units.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

Alon, on the costs, for the cost guidance that was used, it was all the macros, all the assumptions at the
end of January. So if you look at what all the prices were end of January currencies at the end of January,
that sort of set the markup from both the byproduct and the currency factor and all the other cost inputs,
frankly, of which probably the oil price as a factor into the pricing of diesel and all the other attributes sort
of clearly coming in. So it's a fairly up-to-date number around those cost assumptions. I would say all the
cost pressures that we're seeing is generally those passive currency and commodity flow-through which
is having that inflationary side in terms of dollar costs. We're not seeing any other particularly notable
rampant areas of -- and CPI linked, CPI is going up in some [ customer ]. Some of your agreements are
linked to sort of CPI adjustments that might be in contract, things that might be in some of the wage
agreements that you might have as well. But the fact although the commodity prices are higher, it's not
a -- given the capital that's being sent or administered, there's sort of competition for labor and work
and intensity in the sort of normal factors that would feed into it is nowhere near where things were back
in the 2007, '08 sort of period as well where you are having to scramble around just to get basic sort of
talent around in the technical or geological or other sort of fashion that you have as well. So I would --
nothing particularly notable. It's 90% plus would be in just those passive sort of flow-throughs that would
mathematically work through the system. We're not seeing anything that -- and individual countries, of
course, to the extent that, I mean, Australia has obviously got energy. They've got high energy inflation
down there because of some -- arguably some bad policy management around how they've managed sort
of transitions and these things. So things like the refinery in Townsville, we have there had to go towards
sort of getting a new long-term power agreement which could have been worse but it did -- it was quite a
big increase because of what happened down there.

Christopher LaFemina
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Its Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. I have a question about your EBITDA waterfall chart on Exhibit 9 and
unit cost on Exhibit 10. And also a question about the cycle. So first on the EBITDA waterfall chart. If we
take 2016 EBITDA $7.2 billion, add the impact of price that gets to the $13.5 billion. But then you have $2
billion of reductions due to cost inflation, et cetera, which is a little bit surprising when your unit costs in
each of your segments other than coal are either flat or down. And when we think about our kind of 2018
on spot prices, that $19.7 billion of EBITDA, are we expecting what portion of that increase from 2017
to 2018 EBITDA is a function of price? And then what portion of it is a function of those other factors like
volumes and costs actually being a tailwind for your revenue headwind? That's the first question. Does
that make sense? Sorry. Second question on the cycle, maybe kind of related to what Jason was asking
about projects. The fact that we're maybe entering a higher interest rate, higher inflationary environment,
does that -- is there a danger here that mining companies begin to focus more on growth and less on
capital returns? When we think about the benefit of 5% dividend yield, when interest rates are 0, that's
great. When interest rates are 3%, 4%, suddenly there is maybe more an incentive to invest in growth
rather than capital returns. And ultimately, do you think there is a risk here that higher interest rates,
higher inflation is a catalyst to kill the cycle? Or is that not something that we really should be worrying
about this point yet?

21

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Okay, quite detailed questions there, Chris. We probably need a few hours to run through, if we want to
get into the weeds of some of those questions. I mean 2017 was a period where we were still adjusting
volumes to being in sort of containment and supply constraints around sort of looking to sort of accelerate
markets getting to a more sort of tighter period. So we -- if you take ferrochrome and some of these
things, you've seen if you look quarterly across our different volumes there, you've got a very volatile
market, and from time to time you'd accelerate maintenance, you'll bring things forward, then you'll
sort of turn things on. So we went through a period over the last couple of years across most of our
commodities where some of that was clearly also focusing on optimizing around the book. So we had see
-- we did see some -- there was some volume reductions as we went from '16 to '17, which did feed into
that, some of which was planned, some of which was unplanned. I mean, these things happen from time
to time in the industry, I'm pretty confident about our volume guidance this time around as being sort of
more on the conservative end. So let's see how we deliver there and we'll come through in quarter 1. So
the volume impact we have there was power issues down in Zambia, which that operation then lowered
output for a while, which in turn had the flow on effect of reducing asset supply across the border into
Mutanda, which then impacted some cobalt and some copper production down there. So you've seen quite
a material impact through that supply chain come through. You've seen the strike impact over in Australia,
I think we've quantified that across the New South Wales, one was relatively short, we still have one up
at Oaky Creek, I think that was the best part of 6 million, 7 million tonnes at least. Some weather-related
issues in Colombia, a few sort of gray things. So those I would say sort of popped it down to specific sort
of '17 and now we are going copper, coal, cobalt in particular, you'll see that not acting as a tailwind. And
the 2 of them work together when you have those volume reductions, you'll have some impact on your
cost as well. What we've had to do also in Australia during periods we have some strike action like you're
bringing in the temporary workforces and contractors and alike. So you're just keeping the lights on in
the sensibly way ultimately, but that's incurring shorter terms and added cost to the business [ growth ].
You've also got these other, which I would categorize as positive more passive cost impacts which would
-- which we put into that cost line. Arguably, you can put net of pricing, some of the royalty adjustments,
if you like, in coal as well. So we're paying higher royalties across Colombia, South Africa and Australia,
they're feeding into our costs. They totally linked to that improvement in the coal price. Arguably, you
can push that revenue linked over into as a net cost impact as opposed to some sort of headwind that
you have. The increase in fuel cost, in [ passive ], in diesel and the weaker U.S. currencies which also
contributed the sort of $322 million. I would also argue that, that's in the sort of that good consequential
cyclical passive inputs that come through. So that should -- and obviously the byproduct helps in our
business, and maybe we're more endowed in some of the byproducts, it's a function of pure geology on
these things and you have it or you don't have it. And we happen to have a good portfolio mix across
there which is sort of as we then march from '17 and hopefully moving up 46% you're going to see -- I
don't think -- I mean, you shouldn't see other than that positive revenue linked inflation passive flow-
through, I think you're going to see green, green, green as we sort of look towards that box in...

Christopher LaFemina
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So we're definitely $11.5 billion going to the $19.7 billion roughly what portion of that is in price, what
portion of that is [indiscernible].

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

I can't give you specifics on that at the moment, but it's not going to look like this shape in terms of these
things. It's going to have positive volume clearly. Cost is only going to be a function of inflation and those
factors that come through. Byproducts, which we said, is the way that we've held our unit cost is going
to come through the price line. The cobalts, the zincs, the leads, all these products and zinc and alike is
going to come through price and not through the -- in terms of unit cost that's how the industry tends to
report these things. Now we can report in a variety of ways, but that's how we look at these particular
projects. And the quality of the cash generation from a Kazzinc, from a Katanga, from a Antamina, from all
these other businesses that are contributing the significant byproducts. And then FX is going to be a bit of
a tailwind from now, let's see what happens with the dollar.

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

And then on the other part of your question, the growth and higher interest rates. So high interest
rate naturally proves inflation that we're going to high commodity prices, so that's the upside. So there
maybe with higher commodity prices, yes, our competitors and everyone's going to look to grow and
you will eventually have the Greenfield starting. The world's going to have to have it at some stage. If
you believe what we've said earlier, where the demand growth copper going, 500,000 tonnes, et cetera,
and what's going to happen in a lot of the commodities and the decline rates in a lot of the existing
assets today, we're going to have to Greenfields some say. However, if you look at the various different
-- firstly, everyone has been put on hold, you guys have -- investors have ensured that now it's all about
cash versus return of cash to shareholders, which everyone is disciplined and is doing that today. And
there's not a big rush to build new operations. And it's one of the first times I've seen in the industry
where if you look across the industry, how many new mines are being built today in all commodities.
We already talked about Panama, where else is the new mine coming onstream. That there are a few
Brownfield opportunities, which we discussed earlier but not many. There's not many. Maybe in iron ore
there is but in our commodities in copper, in zinc, in nickel, maybe there's stuff where people can expand
down in Indonesia, et cetera, is nickel ore and nickel pig iron can be produced. Thermal coal, Indonesia
is tougher, as I said earlier. So I don't know where you're going to get these big -- okay, Brownfield's
not there. Big Greenfields? Not that many. Who owns those reserves? So it's getting tougher. And most
these Greenfields are going to be in the more difficult countries. Look where you're going to go today.
We're not going to the easy countries, you're not going Australia, you're not even going South Africa.
There's [ empty ] Greenfields down there. So where do you have to go? You're going to go to DRC, yes,
and you have Ivanhoe over there trying to develop Kamoa. You're going to go Mongolia. You're going to
the tough -- you're going to Russia. There will be potentially growth in Russia when does [indiscernible]
eventually get developed. But I don't see many of the big mining companies running to those areas today.
So people are going to have that courage, but it's going to be difficult, because you're going to areas,
limited infrastructure, harder to develop the large mines and more difficult regions. And with the mining
code, potential of mining code is changing, as we're just experiencing in the DRC today. We don't have the
same stability that you get in the better countries. So I don't see many people running to these Greenfield
areas today. So it's going to get tougher.

Tyler Anson Broda
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Tyler Broda from RBC. Just a quick one for me. Just on the coal portfolio mix, seeing the EBITDA
reconciliation for spot, that it's a $16 impact at the end of January versus $10 at the full year. You
mentioned the footnote is the hard coking coal and semi-soft as well as HVO, could you just talk about
some of the dynamics going on there?

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

That's a mathematical -- thanks, Tyler, I mean, for us it's -- I mean, we're trying to give a sort of putting
into right buckets, so everyone sort of can see a Newcastle price on their screen, but coal is hugely
segmented across different qualities, different markets, different grades, different blends, different origins,
some markets stronger, some markets weaker any particular times. So you've seen some of the premiums
and discounts between certain types of coal. I mean, I'm not going to say record levels, but they're at
much high levels than maybe would have been either expected or even historically been witnessed, you're
seeing it in iron ore, you're seeing it in various other grade factors. So what we do, we could have just
given you an average realization and we could be done, but we always like to start at a Newcastle, a
benchmark price because that drives the significant part of our volume, but that doesn't necessarily drive
the Colombian realizations, it doesn't drive all of the South African realizations, it doesn't drive all of
the Australian realizations either. I mean, the thing that HVO is actually it does tend to take you more
towards -- way more towards that market which is ours. So just a mathematical calculation, when we do
all our numbers, run all our pricings at a particular point in time, we started at a Newcastle benchmark
and then work our way. So the higher that number may come at any point in time, clearly it's reflecting

Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

23

GLENCORE PLC FY 2017 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2018

some of the indices and discounts between different origins and different realizations. And also the way
what we do inside that number as well, we effectively treat the, because we're a small play in the Coking
coal market, it's almost treated like a byproduct for the purpose of that buildup in EBITDA. So where
you had the higher prices that we saw in towards last year when you saw what close to the high $300 or
something in coking coal. Now we're in the sort of $200 or something in the semi-soft and that's been a
very volatile market clearly as well. That the higher that is, it also mathematically narrows our discount
there in terms of the byproduct, the sort of net realization if you apply it over the 130 or so tonnes. So it
is a complicated overall buildup of cash generation given qualities and exposures and blends and at time,
and it just reflects the byproduct of coking and the different quality at the particular point in time. And
we'd look to -- that's why we do try and guide in that area as well we sort of can because it's not easy
that's -- I mean, we obviously model it. We have all the drivers to be able to do that. It is the hardest
one for you guys at the room and the marketplace itself to be able to at any point in time appreciating
exactly what's happening across all the different blends and realizations. And some of it is lagging because
you got pricing that might be quarterly. You've got some annual -- this sort of reflects also some of the
realizations that we expect.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

And there's so many different brands of coal within the group, even just within South Africa, if you talk
API4, that's a guideline, but then we got many different coals which don't trade at API4 and the discount
to API4 and you're selling today into India 4,800 kilocal coal as opposed to API4, which is a much higher
kilocal coal, so the discounts and the discounts vary from time to time. So that's the tough one to sort of
get to the right number.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

And we'll try and guide and update as regularly as makes sense because that is the one -- that one needs
more of a steer around how things are developing in that market compared to the others much simpler.

Tyler Anson Broda
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

And just as a follow-up. There's no real correlation then between higher prices meaning a higher portfolio
mix discount in thermal prices if they go up? It's just been a dynamic of how the market has moved into...

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

It's a dynamic relative to the gap between higher and lower pricing and what the coking coal impact is
having in that particular mix as well [indiscernible].

Myles Allsop
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It's Myles Allsop. Just on zinc. Could you just give us a sense as to how you see the market evolving over
the next couple of years? Because we have got Johannesburg, Dugald River. New Century and yourselves
ramping up. There's quite a lot of supply of fields, more than we've seen for the last 5, 10 years sort of
coming into the market sort of outside China. And then just the recent starts of domestical produce in
China seems to step up a bit. Do you think China has sort of addressed some of the environmental issues?
And would your base case be that China keeps grinding down in terms of mine supply?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Look, you've got to look at the zinc market was at 13 million tonnes, what is growth with the emerging
markets and galvanizing which we spoke about. Assume it grows 3%, et cetera, so you do need more
supply. Now the question is you talk about we've gone up. We haven't gone up much. What we're adding
this year, okay, besides other things a 90,000 tonnes roundabout there, and we'll be cautious on the

balance. What else is coming up? You do have the one mine shutting in South Africa and the other mine
coming on from Mutanda that will add a bit, but nothing big, because you do have the one shutting down,
what's it called, Johannesburg. So there's not having Century, we talked about Century, let's see what
happens with Century. And I don't want to talk about another company. But they are taking on old pit, I
don't know the exact numbers they are talking, they're going to be producing, let's see what eventually
happens there. You talk about China, look, commodity prices, zinc rallied last year, we got up to where
we got 3,500, et cetera, and everyone was expecting Chinese production to increase, it didn't. It, in fact,
decreased. So the environmental restrictions are taking its toll. Going forward, hard to predict, we're just
starting, okay, we've hit Chinese New Year -- [ let's see ] post Chinese New Year, with high zinc prices do
we expect them to continue to grow? Talk to our zinc guys, it's hard one to call anything that happens in
Chinese more difficult call, but we don't see it right now.

One quick question on hedging. Any thoughts about especially in the case of thermal coal where the
forward curve is pretty robust right now, any thoughts about hedging future production there?

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes, look, we took a hedge a while ago when we -- when the balance sheet was in the [ top ] of shape
it's in we wanted to [indiscernible] the cash flows there, derisking. We also sold a lot on index and we
wanted to lock out the index. We do have fixed pricing today. We continue having fixed pricing. You don't
see it on the hedging mark-to-market, the Japanese settlement is fixed pricing. Fortunately, you don't
mark-to-market because you're selling actual physical coal, it's not the index. The other one was where
we sold into Europe in a larger amount of coal sold on index and we wanted to hedge there. We continue
to selling a large amount of coal on index. So I don't see anyone -- I don't -- we've no reason to hedge
from a financial point of view. Where we see the market, we don't think it's necessary to hedge. So we're
pretty relaxed, we don't have hedges right now. But we do have a lot of index sales and the opportune
time may come where you may want to lock out some of those index sales, and then you will have your
mark-to-market on hedge. But we have a lot of -- we will have, as we fix our Japanese pricing, we've done
a certain amount, we will do more. I think it's toward April or whatever it is we will do our next pricing
that will be locked in at a price. You won't see it, it will be announced as usual, but you won't see it on the
mark-to-market on hedge. So these are bit of hedged coal in that type of area.

But the drivers that sort of led to that sort of hedging derisk decision back in it was in the middle of
second quarter 2016 or so at that time are sort of completely different with where we are today.

Ivan Glasenberg
CEO & Director

Yes. Different situation.

Steven Kalmin
Chief Financial Officer

So if there's any other things, it's more likely to be short term or tactical sort of things that happened but
nothing on the...
