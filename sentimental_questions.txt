--FILE: Admiral Group plc.txt
Positives
1 Is the underlying trend improving that much
2 And your price increases have lagged the market, so do you genuinely believe that you have underwriting edge when it comes to "escape of water" claims
Negatives
1 So why is it going down so much
2 Is it getting harder as competitors increase their quote footprint and upgrade pricing models et cetera
3  Is the question have prior year -- has prior year development been affected by the fact that claims aren't settling at minus 0.75%

--FILE: Anglo American plc.txt
Positives
1 Why
2 If the outcome of the new mine, potential new mine policy is positive for industry or acceptable, does that mean you are committed to your 3 big South African businesses, Kumba, Coal and Platinum
3 Was it a bit higher than the first half, based on higher profits, balance sheet priorities and returns to shareholders
4 How do we do better and protect that cost base with ongoing improvement
Negatives
1 Is this because   this is the physical constraint, you cannot go higher
2 Have you taken any steps to mitigate the strength of the rand
3 Another question on diamonds, when we see a number of mines still ramping up until 2020, do you believe that this industry could secure enough pricing power before then

--FILE: Antofagasta plc.txt
Positives
1 Is this a good choice for capital deployment
2 Firstly, on cash costs, can you just outline what gives you comfort in reiterating your cash cost guidance this year, particularly given the Chilean peso underpinning your assumptions is significantly stronger on spot prices and also what we're seeing in terms of widespread broad cost inflation pressures already
Negatives
1 Will it meet our required returns
2 Does that eventually delay the first production from expansion if you go through that route
3 Is this an area in your cost forecast or in your cost expectations that you potentially can save more this year than you expect because spot TC/RCs are weaker than kind of benchmark levels

--FILE: AstraZeneca plc.txt
Positives
1 Is it safe to assume you'd say that positive results are highly likely
Negatives
1 Is that predominantly relates to uncertainty on one-off income
2 So I just wondered if you could walk through that
3 I'm just wondering whether consensus was overestimating the impact from the cost-savings programs
4 Which is tougher to get the mortality outcome you need

--FILE: Aviva plc.txt
Positives
1 So what's driving this growth across our markets in '17
2 Am I confident that the actions that I'll walk you through are going to get us back to our combined operational target of between 94% and 96%
3 Does that improve the dividend flows going forward from France
Negatives
1 So which markets do you think will continue to do double-digit and where you would be a bit cautious on double-digit, what you delivered this year
2 Now why did that happen?   Why did we get to see more injury claims
3 Just wondering why that business wasn't appealing to you, especially since you still have the expertise to manage heritage businesses from the Friends deal

--FILE: BAE Systems plc.txt
Positives
1 Is it the current budget situation giving you maybe better visibility and better ability to plan
2 So if we're a bit optimistic and we assume that this year you may win LAND 400, SEA 5000, the CSC in Canada and the ACV in the U.S., if you get these 4 key contracts, could we see revenue recognition fast enough to get to mid-single-digit organic growth as soon as 2020 if ever
Negatives
1 And when do you expect the growth to recover
2 Is there something wrong there
3 And is there a cultural problem with having that inside a big corporate like BAE
4 So why are we not getting more towards the high end of that range of that division
5 So, our contract issuance, is it happening on the pace you'd expect or are we starting to see lags and delays as -- due to the uncertainty connected with the review

--FILE: Barclays plc.txt
Positives
1 But you have this aspiration to grow revenues by GBP 2 billion, at the same time you're now committed to this 6.5p dividend
Negatives
1 How much of that's just due to seasonality, FX translations and so forth and therefore could it bounce back

--FILE: BP p.l.c..txt
Positives
Negatives
1 Is it just excess service capacity that's helping and that might stop in the future
2 Is there something stopping you from pushing towards the higher end of that number or potentially increasing it
3 Now is that because there's excess capacity in the system and suppliers are having to reduce their prices
4 Is there a bit of bounce back there

--FILE: Centrica plc.txt
Positives
1 As you embark on another substantial efficiency program across the group, what makes you confident you'll be able to avoid problems as you remove another 4,000 jobs
2 To what extent is this helped by favorable hedges
3 Is the core EM&T a good place for us to be thinking about over the next few years
Negatives
1 So what is the risk to Centrica of a price cap
2 And are you, therefore, saying that your base case has no EBIT margin erosion as a result of the cap by the time we get to 2020 versus today
3 Are you highlighting a risk around change
4 Can you quantify what is the headwind from the weather impact in '17
5 Do you think that's just a nonstarter for sort of customer concern reasons
6 Or are you factoring in that as a possibility that, if it's successful and turns out to be highly competitive, that Ofgem might try and roll that out
7 Firstly on the dividend, and don't want to simplify it too much, but are you saying the 2018 dividends, you can be very confident of hitting your targets for the 12p, but in 2019, the main variable's obviously going to be the price cap and that's why there's some uncertainty
8 And does that mean the underlying number's actually lower than those headlines
9 And what needs to change to turn that from negative to positive

--FILE: Coca-Cola HBC AG.txt
Positives
1 Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing which gives you the confidence
2 Could you tell us, based on the research that you may have done, what sort of boost to volumes similar big football events have had in the past and the extent to which you expect this sort of a volume boost to materialize in Russia in 2018
Negatives
1 Can you just elaborate on the -- in particular on the investments in the revenue growth initiatives, which were a margin headwind
2 So does that suggest I heard it wrong when I thought I heard you say that it accounted for 40 basis points of margin erosion

--FILE: CRH plc.txt
Positives
1 So are you confident you can beat that this year
2 What has been interesting -- so that's underpinned, right
3 Because there's a general understanding from the consumer that their lives are better off with an improved infrastructure, right
Negatives
1 So I want to understand if you think the cost price spread is starting to at least stabilize or even turn positive

--FILE: Croda International Plc.txt
Positives
1 And then secondly, just in terms of your guidance and the kind of framework, am I right to interpret that there is a kind of renewed confidence in investing in growth in Croda coming forth from this set of results, the success of Incotec, kind of leading you to further accelerate looking for IP
Negatives
1 Should I think that, that's an unsustainably high margin, because you aren't talking about Incotec in the 20% this year
2 On the crop protection side, is that specific to the drift control, the problems Monsanto are having

--FILE: EVRAZ plc.txt
Positives
1 If we were to kind of have another year like 2017 again, what would be the potential improvement in profitability kind of at the EBITDA level
2 If spot remains at this higher level, does that mean you're going to see approximately 50% higher realized price compared to the second half of last year
Negatives
1 So just to start with vanadium, do you expect slight production to return to the 2016 level, so about 10% lower
2 And does that mean sales volumes will also fall by 10%

--FILE: Fresnillo plc.txt
Positives
1 In 2017, where did we have good exploration results
Negatives

--FILE: Glencore plc.txt
Positives
1 Going forward, hard to predict, we're just starting, okay, we've hit Chinese New Year -- [ let's see ] post Chinese New Year, with high zinc prices do we expect them to continue to grow
Negatives
1 Is it starting to concern you a little bit in terms of the momentum that is all those Brownfield expansions are creating
2 Are we too big in certain commodities
3 And second, maybe going back to DRC, because no one seems to ask [ the question ] but what's your relationship with Gecamines like at the moment and this contract review, is that something we should be concerned about
4 Does that make sense
5 The fact that we're maybe entering a higher interest rate, higher inflationary environment, does that -- is there a danger here that mining companies begin to focus more on growth and less on capital returns
6 And ultimately, do you think there is a risk here that higher interest rates, higher inflation is a catalyst to kill the cycle

--FILE: Halma plc.txt
Positives
1 How could they grow more rapidly by expanding in that way
2 How could they grow exponentially
3  And [ just to like ] follow-up, just are there any businesses within the organization which don't fit into your digital strategy?  It's been interesting because it has a really good, great point because the other thing I need to be really careful about was -- what if I'm running a business that's doing something that has -- today has no digital element to it, does that mean I don't fit anymore
Negatives
1 Firstly, can I just ask about fire in the U.S.
2 Am I seeing this completely wrongly

--FILE: Hammerson plc.txt
Positives
1 because I think it rose from 20.1% to 21.7%
Negatives
1 Or could it go lower
2 On the assets that are outside those 3 largest ones, do you think the decline in ERV is still a cyclical factor

--FILE: HSBC Holdings plc.txt
Positives
1 business
2 Is -- do we get any back -- how do we scale that, that you're going to end up with very high capital ratios with all this new issuance
Negatives
1  Just on the extension of the DPA, is there any risk that this affects your ability to withdraw capital from the U.S.
2 Do you think that any of these individual areas that is growing is going to see material pickup or slowdown in 2018 relative to where you are today
3 Is there any issue about the uncertainty around the potential Basel IV impact that may be making you a little bit more cautious on sort of committing to the share buyback

--FILE: Informa plc.txt
Positives
1 Given you did 3.4% sort of in 2017, large network is improving, Business Intelligence improving, academic should be stable, Events continue to remain strong a very good growth rate, so should we expect that to be close to 4% rather than the 3.5% level
2 But given that's somewhat lumpy business and very weighted to the year-end, do you have confidence that, that businesses will genuinely improve
Negatives
1 Firstly, when you talk, Stephen, about the BI progressive organic revenue growth in 2018, I'm just wondering what KPIs you can share with us that underpins your confidence and expectation there
2 Or could we go back to another poor performance in 2018

--FILE: InterContinental Hotels Group PLC.txt
Positives
1 Given you're aiming to deliver this improved growth, basically, on the same cost base, is that partly why you expect that margin enhancement over time, there should be a sort of stronger drop through from new fees from new rooms
Negatives
1 Secondly, is the additional spend going in, is that a sign of the company, perhaps, underinvesting, historically, or indeed a sign of greater competition
2 Is that right, and you're not going to get the full benefit of the costs reinvest until 2020
3 Can you say anything on wage inflation in the U.S., whether it's a positive or a negative, especially with the tax cut
4 Just firstly, in terms of the upscale conversion brand, I appreciate, there's more to follow on that, but is it fair to assume that the fee structure on a conversion brand may be a little lower than the average

--FILE: International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A..txt
Positives
1 Could you update us on the latest with LATAM and [ particularly ] the Asia side of the market given there's pretty explosive growth out of the Chinese carriers into expanding their international businesses
2 So is it that H1 is so strong that you are comfortable giving that guidance
Negatives

--FILE: Intertek Group plc.txt
Positives
1 If you look at the highest level, what is it that Intertek does in the quality assurance industry
2 Why
3 Firstly, could you talk about the improvement you've seen in some of your operational KPIs; and how that rate of improvement looks now, say, versus a year ago
4 Why
5 How many more years of underlying margin improvement can you see in the business, especially in Products division, for example
6 And the other business that was very, very good is electrical, okay
Negatives
1 Do you foresee that continuing

--FILE: ITV plc.txt
Positives
1 Why do you think TV advertising is starting to dislocate from relatively strong macro across Europe given what you said about FMCG and the strong place for TV
2 And then the third question is how do you feel about the way advertising is sold in the U.K., which means 100% [ filler ] inventory, which is not the case in other countries, which kind of prevents you from doing a lot of media for revenues, which has been very successful for even a lot of targeted advertising
Negatives
1 In my mind, that means somebody's losing out

--FILE: J Sainsbury plc.txt
Positives
1 Effectively, if you think about we're opening the doors as Walmart and saying, what is that within our organization that you would like to pull from that would benefit the combined business
Negatives
1 So synergies dropping through or that just being called something else

--FILE: Kingfisher plc.txt
Positives
1 Why
Negatives

--FILE: Legal & General Group Plc.txt
Positives
1 Are we going to see continued growth in that cash remittance number
Negatives
1 It's -- we just released the paper along with the panel that we sponsor and what we've seen in the past, but there is a question of do you get faster improvements if you have more wealth because you can invest in that? Or you already had earlier improvements and, therefore, it may be slower going forward
2 Does it make that harder
3 And does that become an issue for you guys as bulk annuity demand presumably increases

--FILE: Lloyds Banking Group plc.txt
Positives
1 But in crude terms, in the same way that we are committed to improving the cost-to-income every year, you should assume that if you wanted to reconcile the 2, you should assume that the exit rates of the operating costs will be lower than the average of the year, right
Negatives
1 Or do we think that actually, that remains flat and difficult going forward
2 So I wondered what is the source of that

--FILE: London Stock Exchange Group plc .txt
Positives
Negatives

--FILE: NEXT plc.txt
Positives
1 Scene one is would they be successful
Negatives
1 And what happens if we carry on seeing negative like-for-likes

--FILE: Pearson plc.txt
Positives
1 And by this, I mean, school choice charter, virtual schooling, is that a boost and it's sizable enough maybe longer-term to be a positive
2 Can you reassure us that so far so good
3 So Kevin, is President Trump good news for Pearson in our K-12 and vocational businesses? Why is everybody laughing
Negatives
1 higher education, sort of in terms of sharing that sort of wide world structure problems in terms -- if that was sort of holding out very well
2 Sort of on an underlying basis, if you take out K-12, is it probably more the case of the 45% of the business is flat to down with only 55% growing
3 school textbooks courseware business and yet keeping the other assets in the other geographies and whether selling one and keeping the other might have some de-synergistic effects
4 So can you just explain why it was so little
5 And then on the other side, vocational versus college, is that kind of pushing enrollment down to more favorable end for Pearson, which is the shorter or sort of less sophisticated college

--FILE: Persimmon Plc.txt
Positives
Negatives
1 Well, look if this business say over here can achieve that cost, well, what's the problem over here if it's higher
2 Have I bored everybody to death on that now
3 Could you not build more housing more quickly

--FILE: Prudential plc.txt
Positives
1 And some of the optionality we'll talk about later today simply comes from the fact that we have the strength to do this from and that we're   doing this from businesses that are all working well, okay
2 Why it matters is as the landscape is changing and the emergence of the fee-based products and the emergence of post-DOL platforms where a brokerage firm has to decide who are they going to invest millions with to link up technology-wise with a company, one, they've got to believe the firm's committed, they've got to believe they have the technology on the other side and they've got to believe they can actually add enough value to warrant the investment and manage the risk in a way that won't damage the reputation of the firm, okay
3 So Jackson's reputation, historic success, client orientation, wholesaling capability, technology suddenly put it at the front of the pack if you're running a brokerage firm and saying, who am I going to put on my new post-DOL platform, okay
4 business
5 business
6 I think the fundamental -- the -- on the international businesses because you're -- it's -- do we believe their sharing of skills, capital, do we deserve diversification benefit
7 knows about asset liability management, retirement, those things can benefit our Asian business where they're going
8 So can we run it better than them
9 This is -- first cut, are we getting returns that are competitive with anybody globally?   Are we growing in a way that produces quality results that are sustainable
Negatives
1 We did not lose mandates, right
2 We never believed in some of the distribution models competitors took, we took a lot of heat from that for a number of years because we wouldn't do it, okay
3 Chad, can you remind us of the organic rate of build in RBC points, given that you've just seen a significant drop
4 One, on the timing of the transaction and what are some of the key hurdles have you overcome to make it happen
5 would have to be Solvency II qualifying and you'd lose the grandfathering to the switch
6 Is 150% too low
7 Do you think there's a threat there from the rise of online distribution platforms, particularly in China
8 So one of the challenges with Solvency II is not all 150s are alike, right
9 It's very difficult for the net amount at risk -- if it produces a number that's negative to be indicative of them underperforming the guarantee, okay

--FILE: Reckitt Benckiser Group plc.txt
Positives
1 And to what extent could they have been managed better
2 Why
3 So I think the first point on RB 2.0 is, are we doing a good enough job
4 Why
Negatives
1 What happened
2 But do you think it was less, far less
3 To what extent do you think these problems were unavoidable
4 And I did -- I appreciate that there are a lot of moving parts, but what is the issue really

--FILE: RELX PLC.txt
Positives
1 If we assume the FX continues where it is, would you see any margin improvement in that division on a reported basis
2 And research, renewals in line with historical trends, new sales higher than last year, right
3 On the risk division, which bit are you personally sort of most excited about there
4 Is it the opportunities to expand that core Insurance business more globally
5 But just wondering, at what point does that become part of the customer workflow so that we can actually see an acceleration in the growth rate coming from Judge Analytics
6 So you can move more seamlessly between them and get better results   while being more productive because you're eliminating the complexity of stepping in and out, right
Negatives
1 Can you talk a bit about going forward, do you expect continued portfolio changes that could depress margins further or certainly hold back some of the operational improvements that you're seeing
2 Does Legal gets a little bit better or so on
3 So we did not see any of these questions about is one bad, one good
4 And in the last 10 to 15 years, of those, let's call it, 170 consortia that were presumably put together, how many of those failed to reach agreement with you

--FILE: Rentokil Initial plc.txt
Positives
1 I mean, on one hand, you say that the macro -- you expect the macro to get to be improving, but no -- so is your kind of, say, improvement based on the macro
Negatives
1 Is that just a tougher comp affect in the second half
2 And taking these in turn, would you expect these to get better or worse in 2018

--FILE: Rio Tinto Group.txt
Positives
1 So do I believe that the Pilbara will be able to produce 360 or more
Negatives
1 And therefore, this 2018 may be the first year, where the net benefit of those savings will be still slightly negative
2 I think there is no doubt that we had a massive cost increase in terms of [ efficient ] to aluminum last year, as you've said, Paul, and it will continue this year, all right
3 So the question is not are we going to get above 360
4 But I got no doubt that it's going to come, okay
5 So to be honest today, do I feel constrained in terms of growth

--FILE: Schroders plc.txt

--FILE: St. James's Place plc.txt
Positives
1 James's Place an attractive proposition to clients
2 I appreciate solvency is not a very good fit for this business, but given the Life entity generates a lot of the cash for the group, how confident are you that the ratio will remain above 100% without having any impact on the remittances
3 Or should we be seeing some management actions coming through similar to before that, that will certainly help that position
4 Is that creating an opportunity
Negatives
1 Is that likely to continue

--FILE: Standard Chartered PLC.txt
Positives
1 Why
Negatives
1 Is this skewed a little bit more towards Financial Market or to the comparatively weak performance last year

--FILE: Taylor Wimpey plc.txt
Positives
1 Can we infer from that, that you're pretty happy the way you're at on your ratios, as I think about a 54% at the moment on the build side
Negatives
1 And therefore, did the strat land come in a bit below the open market, if I've read that right
2 So -- are we uncomfortable where they are
3 What I was wondering is do they completely leave the business next year as a headwind

--FILE: Tesco PLC.txt
Positives
1 So what are the 30 things in Booker that might be very good for Tesco customers that they currently don't have access to
2 Then how do we grow the earnings
3 So the critical thing for us is do we outperform the market in food volume in order to have the conversations with suppliers that we've had in the past
4 So there are 4 levers by which we can recover margin, not just 1, all right
5 Does that drop through at a pretty healthy margin
6 I think the most important thing and the thing that's worked so well for us over the 3 years is we've decided what it is we want to do for our shoppers, right
7 That keeps us absolutely busy, all right
Negatives
1 First of all, and then come onto your -- first of all, what did I see in Tesco which was a surprise that was bad, okay

--FILE: The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc.txt
Positives
1 Was it in response to ECB engagement or indeed other participating banks and the positive soundings that they've been receiving in terms of buyer interest in their processes
Negatives
1 And with open banking clearly now upon us, whether you think that's going to lead to a reduction in pricing across the industry, and whether you can offset that potentially by gaining market share in places
2 So I was just wondering, is it margin that's changed
3  Is that why, on Slide 30, when you say competitive pressure is 0 in Q4, despite your commentary that front-book pricing on mortgages is very competitive, net effectively, you've got 0 headwind from competition
4 So are we eventually going to see that cost income not being below 50, but maybe dropping down to below 45
5 Will that mean that it's going to be depressed for longer
6 For 17 years of fantastic integration of that bank, that was completely impossible, all right
7 Do you perceive there to be a risk that, that shift will need to be transitioned in advance of 2021, in the context of your engagement with the PRA
8 Is it more a case of stopping profitability going down in the future

--FILE: Unilever PLC.txt
Positives
1 Is it fair to say that you feel like -- you feel better about your underlying sales growth for the front half of 2018, that maybe it's -- maybe a little bit more weighted to that front half growth-wise
2 So can you clarify a little bit better why you've seen the pickup and where things are going well
Negatives
1 And also, category growth, which has been stubbornly pegged at 2% by value, is there any sign of that improving
2 There are a few moving parts with softer pricing, spreads disposal, cost savings, are you able to give us a more specific range for where you expect 2018 EBIT margin to be

--FILE: WPP plc.txt
Positives
1 Why
2 So what makes you confident that you can deliver that
3 Is it just about sort of better effectiveness internally
Negatives
1 Thirdly, are ZBB models, activists and private equity driving down marketing costs
2 Fourthly, are clients increasingly in- housing marketing activities
3 And fifth and last, are innovation and branding still important
4 And what would you say to people that would say that the fact that you have taken down your earnings growth target in the longer term would suggest that actually you do think there are structural impacts coming through and they are impacting your business
5 I think December '16 was not as strong as probably we would see in December of '15 or '14, would you
6 Is that a risk or an opportunity for WPP
7 And looking at your account wins, I'm just wondering, are you perhaps focusing in the wrong place or putting too much emphasis on new account wins since we can see they're not really driving growth
8 So when your peers are talking about 2% to 3% growth, and I think someone is even talking about mid-single-digit growth, do you think you are being too optimistic
9 And do you see any headwinds specific to WPP that means you might underperform your peers in 2018
10 I don't know whether you can just give us a feel in terms of which industries you think you're going to perform better and which for industry you think is going to perform worse within that sort of flat budget process so we get a sense of which clients, where you think the weakness may stem from
