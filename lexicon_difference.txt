   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.08  0 I'm going to talk through some of the highlights of the results covering the turnover, customer growth, profits; move on to talk about capital and dividends
   0.00  1 We're going to go into some detail on both of those figures shortly, so I'll just highlight double-digit increases in both again, with all parts of the group growing, particularly in households in the U.K
   0.18  0 On profitability, you'll have seen we're reporting GBP 405 million of pretax profit, earnings per share of 117.2p
   0.00  1 Those are both record figures
   0.00 -1 Of course, the comparisons are clearly very impacted by Ogden that hit on 2016
   0.00  1 That's 11% up on 2016 if you exclude the additional capital return we paid in 2016
  -0.12  1 And finally, in the middle, solvency ratio remains very strong, still up over 200%, albeit a bit lower than it was at the end of 2016
   0.00  1 The picture looks pretty similar to recent reporting periods, strong growth in all segments, lots of green arrows
  -0.12  1 And customer numbers were up by 1/5, breaking through 1 million customers outside the U.K., continued strong momentum
   0.00  1 And more than 10% growth in the turnover from the Price Comparison businesses as well
   0.25  0 Moving on to talk about profits
   0.17  0 That's why I wanted to show the full profit trajectory since that first year back in 1993
   0.00  1 Hopefully, you'll agree it's an   enviable track record
  -0.12  0 As I said earlier, the comparison is distorted by Ogden, and so I'll talk more about the U.K
   0.00  1 The International Insurance result improved again to a GBP 14 million loss compared to GBP 19 million the year before
   0.20  0 And that latter result come in despite the hit from the hurricane in Texas in 2017
  -0.14  0 And 2016 included an unrealized gain on foreign exchange forward contracts
  -0.17  0 There's a breakdown of those costs in the appendix, if you're interested
   0.00  1 This slide also helps illustrate progress in International Insurance, where since 2015 we've doubled our turnover and reduced the loss by 1/3
  -0.33  0 Changing subjects to look at capital
  -0.17  1 The familiar-looking slide here shows our solvency ratio is still very strong, again over 200%
   0.06  0 The main movements since the middle of the year, as you'd expect, the second half profits, deducting the final dividend and some increase in the capital requirement which was mainly due to the growth in our balance sheet but also the expected volumes we see in 2018
   0.00  1 We still think at this stage that 150% is a good indicator of the upper end of our target range once we get that internal model approval, but of course, we do recognize that 200% is somewhat north of 150%
   0.11  0 And to that point, I'll repeat the message of 6 months ago, which is that until we've got certainty over the internal model capital position, we won't talk more about any potential surplus capital position
   0.12  0 And what I mean by certainty over the internal model position is getting the internal model approved
  -0.10  0 And 58p per share is 97% of the second half earnings, still leaving us with a 205% solvency ratio you saw on the previous slide
   0.00  1 And I'd also reiterate that, unless or until we say otherwise, payout ratios in the 90s is a good guide for dividends going forward
   0.07  0 Given the relative size and maturity of the business, we're not going to go into too much detail at this stage, though some of the key messages in terms of our product and our progress are set out on the slide
   0.00 -1 We're, of course, aware that there are potentially uncertain economic times ahead
   0.00  1 business
   0.00  1  Good morning, everybody
   0.00  1 Bell is now a telematics-only brand that we sell via Price Comparison, and it's helping Admiral to stay as a telematic leader in the market
   0.00  1 It has been another good year of growth
   0.00  1 In terms of units, our motor book has grown by 8%
   0.00  1 In terms of turnover for motor, it has grown by 13%
   0.00  1 And that includes an increase of 11% in car, reflecting our price increases
   0.00  1 In the case of household, both customers and turnover have increased by 41%
   0.33  0 As for profits, Geraint has already talked about them
  -0.25  0 Moving on to claims in the market
   0.00 -1 You can see here in the graph it went down with about 12% in '17 following a 19% reduction in '16
   0.11  0 The prospect of a reform might lead to some lawyers to choose to focus on other sectors and less on motor
  -0.33  0 On the right, you can see a graph about accidental damage in the market
  -0.40  0 In the case of Admiral, our own claims experience for both small BI claims and accidental damage has been consistent with the rest of the market
  -0.11  0 What we can tell you is that for Admiral 2017 frequency of large BI claims appears to have been okay, especially in the context of Ogden
  -0.10  0 So what you can see in this graph is that depreciation of the times top of Admiral at the end of 2016 and at the end of 2017 is actually quite similar
  -0.33  0 Now before talking about what are prices going to do in 2018 in our view, I want to talk about excess of loss
  -0.50  0 As we all know, the cover of excess of loss has increased its price this year
  -0.17  0 And Admiral, what we did in 2017, as a reminder, we put more cover to cover for the shock of Ogden because the prices in the market were fine in our view
  -0.50  0 So that's in terms of excess of loss
  -0.50  0 Now 3 things that could affect what the market is going to do: first, excess of loss
   0.00  1 You have Admiral data in blue and the market in red
  -0.20  0 So for Admiral, the loss ratio [ and then ] high discount rate
   0.00 -1 And this -- in this environment of uncertainty, we prefer to take a cautious view
   0.00  1 car reserve releases continued to be a strong feature of our results
   0.00  1 Reserve releases in '17 were 21% ahead of the long-term average of around 15%
   0.00  1 The margin in booked reserves remained prudent and significant, but it's slightly smaller in relative terms than the one at the first half of 2017
  -0.11  1 And going forward, we expect a -- continuing significant reserve releases if claims develop as expected
   0.00  1 So in terms of households, I think the most important feature of our result has been the strong growth of 41% in a time where the rest of the market is not showing a lot of growth
   0.00  1 The first one is the fact that Price Comparison, which is our main channel, has continued to grow, as you can see on the graph
   0.00 -1 The second reason is that there have been price increases in the market
  -0.17  1 Admiral has also increased the prices of its household book, but it has lagged the market, which has allowed us to grow
   0.00  1 In the case of the loss ratio, we have seen an improvement during 2017
   0.00  1 The good weather has helped, definitely nothing like today
   0.00  1 And we're very proud to say that today all our products hold a 5-star Defaqto rating option
   0.00  1 So in summary, 2017 has been another good year of growth for the Admiral UK Insurance business
   0.00  1 The car insurance market has seen increases, and Admiral has put increases in line with the rest of the market
   0.30  0 I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to the people of Sardinia for their exclusion and assure them that they can buy policies from ConTe
  -0.18  1 Elephant had a year of growth, 8% up in terms of number of cars covered; and a year in which the losses shrunk both in absolute and percentage terms, Admiral share of losses falling from $21 million to $16 million
   0.00  1 And Admiral has improved from 143% 3 years ago to 119% last year against some degree of headwind from the market, which has been unusually difficult for the U.S
   0.00  1 auto insurance market with an increase from 103% to 109% over the 2 years to 2016
   0.25  0 So Elephant is on a journey towards profitability
  -0.15  0 However, we do always run stress scenarios at the end of each year, and there are certain stress scenarios in which Elephant would not fully return the investment we've made
   0.33  0 And I think you can see here the progress that has been made
   0.00  1 And again, you can see a situation where we've made progress, notably in 2017, against a difficult market context where the whole market in the U.S
   0.33 -1 2017, our 76% was achieved despite Hurricane Harvey, which would have affected us and actually the market as a whole
   0.11  0 And the conclusion of the work that they did is that we should focus more on one specific segment, and that's what we've done
   0.11  0 In the other extreme, there are multi-car, relatively affluent customers who typically shop much less often but are much more loyal
   0.00  1 It's been a good year
   0.33  0 It is actually the third brand in the Allstate stable
   0.00  1  Hello
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.00 -1 2017 was a mixed year for price comparison side
  -0.50  0 It was a year of investment in Confused
   0.00  1 We believe that this new strategy will help us to differentiate ourselves
   0.20 -1 Profit decreased year-on-year as a consequence of the investments
   0.00  1 In Continental Europe, we experienced another year of strong growth both in France and in Spain
   0.00  1 We do believe that this investment will help us, the channel to grow
   0.00  1 2017, as 2016, was another year of very strong growth
   0.00  1 We grew 60% in active policy base and turnover, reaching EUR 309 million revenues in '17 and 854,000 customers
  -0.14  1 The first things you may notice is that loss ratio is in a very good range, while expense ratio is over market average
  -0.33  0 This is why, for us, reaching a decreasing expense ratio is crucial and is critical
   0.00  1 And one of the most notable results, in my opinion, for the year is a strong reduction of 5 points combined in Europe while growing at the same time
   0.00  1 And we are reducing the cost per policy in every single country
  -0.33  0 Loss ratio combined in Europe has been between 70% and 80% in the last 4 years
   0.00  1 We believe that's very good results
   0.00  1 And 2016 was a year of extraordinary reserve releases, particularly for ConTe, while the underlying loss ratio is relatively stable
   0.00 -1 It's also worth to remind that we adopted a more conservative approach in booking in France and Spain as we are already doing in Italy and U.K
   0.00  1 Results for the year was also positively impact by reinsurance contract, in 2017 in particular
   0.00 -1 It broke even on written basis for the first time, while in the past we had to wait a few years to realize the profitability on written basis because we have to wait for the loss ratio, ultimate loss ratio, estimates to improve
   0.00  1 And ConTe was scored second best place to work in Italy for the second year in a row
   0.00  1 But the most notable results of all is definitely passing the mark of 500,000 customer
   0.00 -1 They share similar challenges and somewhat similar opportunity
   0.00  1 The project is going well and according to plans
   0.00  1   So to wrap up: a year of investment in Confused; very strong growth both on price comparison side and insurance company in Continental Europe; improving results in each single business, in each operation, with reduced combined losses overall; and record profit for ConTe
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 And the latest survey was particularly gratifying, seeing us voted as the third best big company to work for
   0.00  1 And last year, we managed 23rd on the global best companies to work for award, so it's lovely to see that culture being exported internationally
  -0.25  0 I'm just going to finish then with a quick restatement of our strategy
   0.00  1 And what's proved to be exportable is talent in risk selection and a low-cost expense culture
   0.00 -1 Beyond that, we've had to do a lot of adapting
   0.14  0 And I think the Elephant positioning towards particular segments in the U.S
  -0.12  0 Claims handling in Italy is another example, where there's a lot that we've learned over time
  -0.12  1 And I think we're now ahead of the market on claims handling in the Italian market
   0.12  0 Lastly, in developing sources of growth beyond insurance, again we seek to develop on our strengths, so we're looking for intangible services sold at a distance ideally
   0.17  0 We're looking for products sold through price comparison sites ideally
   0.00  1 So thank you for that
  -0.20  0 She's moving on up to be the CFO at Confused
   0.00  1 Congratulations, Karen
   0.00  1 And thank you for all your help
   0.33  0 Two numbers themed, please; and an observation
   0.00 -1 And finally, just an observation: My view, your business model is very cryptic a financial structure
  -0.17  0 And by dropping, I -- if I heard correctly, you're going to drop the ultimate disclosure, I think, that makes a cryptic business model even more cryptic
  -0.33  0 There was a comment about dropping the ultimates..
   0.33  0  Okay, let me do the 2 easy ones
  -0.50  0 On our excess of loss, Page 44 is full detail of the history of our excess of loss
   0.17  0 So far, we have felt that it is not commercially advantageous to invest beyond our investment in that area
  -0.17  0 You still run a 20 percentage point higher loss ratios there, though
   0.25  0 price comparisons, you talked about the progress you made
  -0.20  1 So our loss ratio in the household book is much higher than the market
   0.00 -1 Several reasons
   0.00 -1 First, we are still learning
   0.00  1 We have been 4 or 5 years, so we're collecting more data, improving how experience -- or sorry, how we handle our claims
   0.00  1 So we expect to improve our loss ratio
   0.00  1 The second reason is in the market the retention is very high
   0.00 -1 The third reason is, price comparison, it's only 50% of the market
  -0.17  0 There will be more comparison in prices, and that would allow us to get to the loss ratio in the market
   0.00 -1 There is a lot of noise
   0.00  1 So the actual pure comparison market is very small but growing fast
   0.00 -1 In terms of shopping activity, it is a bit higher than it was 2 years ago, but I think you -- we'll have to see whether that's structural or whether it's a response to the fact that prices have been increasing in the U.S
  -0.20  0 A couple of questions on the European insurance business, if I may
  -0.17  0 Or is it a bit of distortion in the second half? And secondly, you mentioned price increases in Italy and France
   0.14  0 So can you give more color of magnitude of price increases, particularly in France, please?  Yes
  -0.08  1 I mentioned that one of the reason why -- one of the positive impact on 2017 is there is also some distortion of reinsurance contract with some deferred profitability on 2017 versus previous years
  -0.22  1 On the price increase, the reality is that in Italy we're suspecting a quite strong price increase in the last actually couple of years
  -0.25  1 And this has been postponed mainly because good underwriting results
   0.00 -1 I find your results now increasingly obscure
  -1.00  0 So that was the second question
   0.00  1 The third question is you say that your times top has got better, but I noticed that you actually   put on more car policies in the first half than the second half, so should we be looking for an acceleration in the number of car policies on the books in '18 rather than '17?  I mean a comment around the profit and loss account and the recognition of results
  -0.25  0 So we show you the loss ratios booked by underwriting year
  -0.33  0 We show you the accident year best estimates
   0.00  1 And we try our best
  -0.25  0 In terms of claims evolution during 2018, we think it's going to be a continuation of the benign trends of '17, so that is an increase in accidental damage overall and a continuation of the reduction in the small BI claims
   0.00 -1 I think it's harder to predict
   0.00 -1 So overall, it's going to be benign, but it's hard to predict very concrete
   0.00 -1  Big margin compression?  I don't think so, but that's our view at the moment
  -0.20  0 Then your question about the growth in '18, I think there are 2 components to growth
  -0.25  0 3 questions from me, all on U.K
  -0.10  0 The second is you disclosed that the terms for the co-insurance arrangement with Munich Re have changed slightly so that you get the installment income
  -0.09  0 And also whether actually this is reflecting any broader changes in the terms of the agreement there, recognizing of course that there's a limit to what you can say given the confidentiality
   0.00 -1 At half year, you said that, while of course you continue to have enormous   amounts of prudence, you relaxed prudence slightly
  -0.09  0 Is this are we expecting sort of a still very prudent but not quite as prudent as before from now on?  Geraint, do you want to take all three?  I'll give it a go
   0.17  0 Ogden, the GBP 40 million hit this year mainly affects profit commission
   0.11  0 Effectively, I think we said GBP 200 million pretax impact, just about; and about GBP 150 million of that, now we've taken
   0.17  0 There's been a slight shift where we get all the installment income, but of course, we therefore make less profit and so we get less profit commission
   0.00 -1 And the final one is prudence in the reserves: We talked at the half year about bringing the size of the conservatism relatively down
   0.00 -1 If you go back pre Ogden, we were saying that we would expect to bring the level of conservatism down over time had things gone back to normal times
   0.00  1 And so we increased the size of the margin at the end of '16
   0.00 -1 We brought that down in the middle of '17 and down very gradually in the second half of '17 as well
   0.00  1 It's higher than the long- term average
   0.00 -1 I think, had we kept the margin broadly the same as the end of the previous year, we'd have been back in that sort of normal range, something of that order
  -1.00  0 2 questions
  -0.17  0 One, on the ultimate loss ratios in the U.K
   0.00  1 And they haven't changed in '13, '14, '15, I think, or '14, '15, '16, but my understanding was the Ogden claim was settling a better rate than the minus 0.75
  -0.17  0 And then the second question, just on the new products you mentioned right at the end
   0.00  1 And so we feel it's an interesting product
   0.00 -1 It just creates more uncertainty
  -0.60  0 Just going back to the question on accident year loss ratio
  -0.15  0 So I was just wondering if you could break down or break that improvement down between what's coming from benign claims, price increases and actually what's the conservatism which you have released
  -1.00  0 That will be the first question
  -0.14  0 Just wondering in terms of are there any changes to the terms of the contract as well in terms of, if the Ogden rate moves, will the price change as well with it
  -0.14  0 And just finally, in -- some of your peers are still talking "escape of water" claims inflation in home
  -0.60  0  Just remind me what the excess of loss question was, Waj
  -0.25  0  He asked, I think, just if there was any other change to the terms of the contract
   0.00  1 The first one was the improvement in the current year loss ratio from half year to full year
  -0.17  0 And I think it's we're not going to break down it into its various components
  -0.25  0  And the final question was around escape of water in household
  -0.25  0 And we did experience some inflation of this type of claims during 2016 and took action both in claims management and in pricing
   0.00 -1 And during 2017, escape of water hasn't been a big issue for us
  -0.08  0 What are you exactly doing to turn that business around?  Well, the rationale of the strategy on Confused is you've got 4 players which in terms of their offering are relatively undifferentiated
  -0.17  0 And we are seeking to differentiate Confused going forward as the price comparison site for motorists
  -0.14  0 We're developing car buying and selling options on Confused
   0.11  0 There's also been an investment in communicating the repositioning towards motorists solely and the driver wins through the James Corden campaign
   0.33 -1 That has cost us in terms of profitability
   0.00 -1 In terms of its long- term outcome, it's still uncertain
  -0.14  0 And that's carried through into the first couple of months for Confused, but this is a long-term repositioning and not a short-term issue
  -0.25  0 Just a question on U.K
   0.00  1 car unit growth in terms of customer numbers
   0.00  1 Having said that, to be able to grow the business as we have, 5% for the core car insurance business and much more substantially if you look across the whole portfolio of products, it suggests that we are able to do that competitively and produce a very good return
  -0.20  0 Particularly on the Munich Re contract
   0.20  0 I just think we need some further clarity on that, please
  -0.19  0 I think there's -- very little of the impact on our projected ultimate loss ratios have come from the fact that claims haven't been settling at minus 0.75% because the settlement patterns are disrupted
  -0.25  0 And the very largest of losses aren't settling in the sorts of numbers you'd abnormally expect them to settle at
  -0.11  0 So there's been some, clearly, because some claims have settled at a rate or an implied rate at least that isn't minus 0.75%
  -0.14  0 And we certainty haven't banked a lot of credit for lots of other claims not settling at that rate
  -1.00  0 Last questions..
  -0.50  0  Sure, last questions
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.33  0 Excess of loss premium, I wonder if you can just give us the actual number for '15, '16 and '17
   0.00  1 You don't -- I mean -- and you don't choose Madrid because it's close to Gibraltar, but there are a number of very strong reasons around the fact we've got an -- existing relationships with the regulator
   0.00  1 It's a nice place to be
  -0.40  0 In terms of the excess of loss, we'll think about it
  -0.11  0 It's not that material an item in our cost structure, so I wouldn't overly worry about it
  -0.14  1  It's an indicative increase for people who have a structure similar to ours with quite a high retention
  -0.50  0 Claims inflation..
  -0.50  0 Could -- claims inflation
  -0.12  0 And I'm sure your model is sophisticated enough to incorporate that into historic claims inflation
   0.14  0 So it's not as easy to say, look, the actual result in 2017 was X or Y
   0.00 -1 And the really interesting issue is do those small BI trends continue, flatten off, reverse
   0.12  0  It's not indicative of kind of inflation? [ Do you think it's ] positive?  Unlikely
  -0.13  0 And it -- can I ask if there's anyone on the phones who's interested in asking a question? We do have a question from the telephone line from the line of Dhruv Gahlaut from HSBC
  -1.00  0  I have 3 questions
  -0.17  0 Are they still based on the negative 75 (sic) [ 0.75% ], or are they around the 1% mark?  It's all yours, Geraint
  -0.33  0  Co-insurer contracts for 2019 will be extended
  -0.33  0 We have no more questions from the telephone lines

   0.29  0 It's my great pleasure to welcome you all to our 2017 Full Year Results Presentation
   0.17  0 The simplest way is to go back out this way you came and follow the signs, and you'll be shepherded out, I'm assured
   0.00  1 We had 2 new Non-Executive Directors join us, Nolitha Fakude, a South African businesswoman; and Ian Ashby, a long-serving mining -- very experienced miner
   0.25  0 And finally, myself, who had the great privilege and pleasure to take over from Sir John Parker as Chairman of Anglo American
   0.33  0 What I would encourage you to do, again, is to catch them after the presentation
   0.00  1 So, again, thank you very much for joining us here today
   0.06  0 And then finally, pull apart our capital allocation and the discipline that I think's been very important behind the performance improvement over the last 5 years and talk about how we're thinking about the future in terms of capital allocation
   0.00  1 I think the simple message is we've done what we said we'd do
   0.00  1 EBITDA margins are up 15% at 40%
  -0.18  0   We have established an Elimination of Fatalities task force, working across the business looking to drive the next level of performance to 0
  -0.33  0 6 of those fatalities were in platinum and 3 in coal in South Africa
   0.00  1 Across occupational health and the environmental issues have been well managed during the course of the last few years
   0.00  1 Over the same time, we've seen a 27 -- 26% reduction in unit costs
   0.00  1 In terms of EBITDA margins, we're up to 40%, and that's the see-through margin based on the mining business itself
   0.00  1 And the other one was, being the good finance person I am, about capital discipline and cash flow management
   0.00  1 So it is a good set of numbers, as Mark said
   0.00  1 And importantly, for me, it's a clean set of numbers; so the things that we've been focusing on through the business simply showing through the numbers and the outputs
   0.00  1 The other important thing for me and for Mark and the whole executive team is really that we've been delivering on our commitments
   0.00  1 And that's a really important fact for us
   0.00  1 And it's really the combination of those things that sets us up also for a very, very strong 2018
   0.00  1 So we have had some sort of upside from commodity prices
  -0.40  0 If you recall at the start of the year, we'd identified a $1 billion challenge
   0.09  0 We haven't had the benefit of low inflation and even in areas like the Pilbara, you've probably seen deflation in recent years
   0.00  1 I think the other thing I would just remind you of, often, in a period of higher inflation, it's driven by increased activity, which is fundamentally good for commodity prices in most cases
   0.00 -1 Now the next dollar gets harder than the last dollar
   0.00 -1 We did have some headwinds this year
   0.00 -1 We had extensive rains through Southern Africa in the first quarter
  -0.50  1 So we were able to overcome those and deliver the $1.1 billion
  -0.50  0 But we're not going to stop here
   0.10  0 And as we look forward then across that period to 2022, we'll really start to pick up some of the themes of innovation and technology
   0.00  1 It's the sum of an enormous number of parts that help us deliver this
   0.10  0 For those of you that need to balance your books in terms of looking forward, effective tax rate in the low 30s as we go forward
  -0.25  0 You recall at the start of the year, we'd guided to $2.5 billion
   0.00 -1 We revised that guidance down to $2.3 billion
   0.00 -1 Couple of reasons
   0.04  0 There's a little bit of rollover from 2017 for things that we still need to get done, some stronger currencies that we're assuming as we look forward; and then there's some stay-in-business capital for some of those new projects that we've delivered or for assess that we've maintained within the portfolio
  -0.07  0 As we look beyond that in terms of some longer-term guidance, $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, just to note that, that excludes unapproved projects, but it does include things like the Venetia underground that are already sort of in the system
   0.08  0 This is really a "once in a financial director's life cycle" that you get to fundamentally reset the balance sheet in the way that we have that opportunity now
   0.00  1 Now we are seeing strong bulk prices, in particular, continue
   0.00  1 And that's generating fairly significant cash flow for us
   0.00  1 As we look at returns to shareholders, I suppose this is, for us, a really good example of just simply doing what we said we'd do
   0.00  1 So dividends are up $0.06 to $0.54, brings the total payment for the year to $1.02 or $1.3 billion to shareholders off the 2017 result
   0.00  1 So sustainable cash flow really underpins both the balance sheet and the returns to shareholders
   0.00  1 Right now, though, we think we've got the right sort of balance in terms of returns to shareholders, continued de-gearing of the balance sheet and sensible growth where it suits us within the portfolio
   0.09  0 Won't talk to the numbers, you can see, clearly, the priority was allocating cash flow to strengthening the balance sheet and appropriate returns to shareholders
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Our EBITDA margins are up 33%, and this is against the 2013 performance
   0.08  0 I'd like also to talk about how we think about capital allocation in the context of the future evolution and improvements we see available to us in the business
   0.00  1 We've started in the new year with a second longwall and so far, so good
  -0.20  0 On disposals and closures, we've done a lot of cleanup work through the year, and you will see some of those transactions confirmed in January
   0.00  1 We like what we have in terms   of the assets
  -0.25  0 In the last 3 years, we've gone through major restructuring of all our businesses in South Africa
   0.00  1 The deferral of the court case around the Mining Charter, I think's a very important development
   0.00  1 From our point of view, we want policy certainty and that we make sure that we're doing the right things in the country to make sure that we've got a competitive industry
   0.00  1 Our track record over the last 5 years has been one of discipline and delivery
   0.00  1 And our production was actually 9% higher than it was in 2012
  -0.21  0 Second, any expansion object -- or any expansion proposal that we look at is subject to intense competition for capital and is scrutinized against strict investment criteria at each stage gate
   0.00  1 In copper, we've got significant growth options both inside the assets that we've got operating today and with our greenfields potential in the Quellaveco
   0.00  1 We like the commodity, we like the resources we've got, we like the assets we've got
   0.00  1 And as we see demand growing, we have the capacity to respond to the market in a sensible way without significant capital allocation
   0.00  1 And they're looking for something that's special, that's unique and that says something special about the event and the person which they're celebrating that event with
   0.00  1 And from our point of view, we think that's very important in making sure that we promote our goods and see growth in the market
  -0.09  0 And on the other side of the coin in terms of synthetics, I think certainly deserve a comment as we've had a few questions from people in the market
   0.00  1 From our point of view, it's important that we continue to differentiate the value proposition for a diamond
   0.00  1 It's unique
   0.00  1 The overall growth in demand for vehicles continues to outweigh the switching from diesel to small-scale electric vehicles
   0.00  1 We expect that those trends will hold reasonably well up to 2030
   0.00  1 Certainly, as an industry, we have to do more to promote our products, but from our point of view, we think the prognosis for our products is very solid over the next few years
   0.14 -1 Amandelbult, significant resource, needs to continue to improve its cost
   0.17 -1 We need to continue to improve to make sure we stay there
   0.14  0 Seamus and Peter are partners in positioning those products at the top end of the revenue scale
   0.00  1 And for us, margins drive returns
   0.06  0 We have a number of other options across the portfolio, copper, De Beers, PGMs, Mogalakwena, met coal, a number of options that we can kick into place depending on market demand and the margins that we see can be delivered from those assets
  -0.33  0 Over the last 5 years, we've restructured the business
   0.00  1 On a broader front, the technical team, led by Tony and with the business unit leaders, we've got loftier ambitions in terms of step changes
   0.11  0 They will tend to be a little back-end loaded given the innovation work and where we are progressing with energy, water, the concentrate, the mine, coarse particle flotation, but they certainly -- they will certainly start making a contribution inside that time frame
   0.00  1 With that type of culture, the quality of the portfolio is important
   0.00  1 It also provides us with the flexibility to think about where we are in the market and make judgments inside those assets in terms of the best way to operate them under various market conditions
   0.00  1 Second, we've built the people capabilities to get the best out of those assets
   0.00  1 And three, we've   instilled an operating and capital discipline that understands our job is to deliver cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis
   0.00  1 So with that, very happy to take questions
  -0.50  0 Mark, 2 related questions, I guess
  -1.00  0  Two good questions
   0.00 -1 On Minas-Rio today, the license -- the final license has remained a constraint on the footprint for the mine
   0.00  1 So that Stage 3 license has been very important to us
   0.00 -1 So now it's just physical constraint on the footprint
   0.00 -1 So that's the key issue
   0.00  1 We've been through all of the process with the locals, with the government, very supportive of the project
  -0.08  0 And if anything, they're arguing that we may have been a little bit conservative in the process, that's good news, but let's wait and see what the final outcome is in terms of the review
   0.00 -1 In the last 5 years, against all of the major projects that we had when I started back in 2013, we've delivered all of those projects on time for $1 billion less than the estimate I gave you back in 2013
  -1.00  0 I have a few questions
   0.00 -1 I wonder to what extent this could be because of one- off factors
   0.00 -1 And I think the taxes paid were also about $600 million below the -- a figure on the net -- on the income statement
  -0.50  0 That's question number one
   0.00 -1 Third, the diamond production guidance, you expect 2018 to be a bumpy year and then, production to go down to about 20 -- up to about 32 million carats
   0.00 -1 It's a bit lower than what people were expecting
   0.00 -1 So I can't promise we're going to continue to reduce it
   0.00 -1 Inventories, in fact, were probably a little bit higher than we'd hoped in a couple of areas, so
  -0.09  0 In Kumba, and in met coal in particular, we couldn't quite get all the tonnes to the ports that we wanted
  -0.07  0 And one of the bigger things in that has been the prepayment that we have through the platinum business increased again this year, and also some of the change in the arrangements as we have moved some of the operations and joint ventures into sort of processing of concentrates and POC contracts
   0.40 -1 And that's just timing, as we have come out of constructions and lower prices into profits
   0.00 -1 So nothing odd particularly, sort of pull out there
   0.00  1 If you think back, we had a big kick up in sales really last year, which was the release of the lower priced carats
   0.00  1 This year, Bruce has set the organization up to deliver against what we think the demand will be
   0.00  1 What Bruce is doing at the moment is looking in the sequencing of some of the other operations, to see that if that demand remains strong, what he can do to bring a bit more production forward to get more balance in the second year
   0.20  0 And if there's an opportunity to make more sales, we don't want to miss a sale
   0.12  0 And so the team's very focused on balancing up, depending on where the market is
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions
  -0.33  0 First question, just on unit costs
  -0.50  0 And then the second question, just on South Africa
  -0.06  0 I mean, obviously, this is an imbalance that, as you've said, should normalize over time, but shouldn't you monetize or may take opportunity of this imbalance to monetize some of those assets?  Firstly, on the unit cost, we're going to continue
   0.00  1 For us, the imperative is to continually improve our costs
   0.00  1 And we've done a pretty good job of that
   0.00 -1 In fact, our unit costs on a nominal basis are down 26% over the 5 years
  -0.25  0 So there are 2 imperatives that we talk about on a monthly basis
   0.00  1 That's what our job is, to make sure the business is setup well
   0.17  0 What we have embedded in there in terms of cost improvement is only those things that we have specifically identified
  -0.08  0 So yes, we can take you through the detail later, in terms of some of the individual assets in that, but there's some subtle influences in there that are just influencing some of the volumes as they drop out in '18
   0.00  1 So the restructuring Chris, Kumba, Seamus, the rest of the crew, in all parts of the business, the dam has been very successful
   0.00  1 So we're not shy about saying the guys have done a good job in South Africa
   0.20  0 The political changes,   the leadership, the hand that has been extended by the government continues to encourage us, but there's still a lot more work to be done
   0.00  1 And what I would say is, we're starting to see more significant contributions outside our portfolio
   0.00 -1 So I'm not doing well
   0.00  1 So the family is transforming
   0.08  0 To come back to the point I made, when I was earlier, encourage you to think about the other things that move with currencies and inflation, and that's normally commodity prices
   0.00 -1 So as you've seen this year, the impact of prices far outweighed the impact of FX and inflation
   0.17  0 So just to encourage you to think about all of those 3 moving parts, as you think about the currency
   0.00  1 And I think that's going to be really important
   0.00 -1 And we're still not where we want to be in terms of benchmark productivity
  -1.00  0 Two questions
   0.00  1 But with Kumba, with PGMs in terms of Anglo platinum and in terms of thermal coal, good assets, delivering good returns
   0.20  0 And we're encouraged, we'll wait to see what we get out of the policy conversations
  -0.14  0 Long haul hours and cutting rights through each of the met coal operations
   0.00 -1 It had a pretty tough year in 2017
   0.08  0 Now there's a lot of things that are going to come through and feed through our business as we keep getting more disciplined, and then adapting and running with technology and innovation
   0.08  0 And then, particularly on the innovation side, the things that Tony's previously spoken about, about our water use, our crushing technology, our recovery and our use of energy
   0.00  1 And we'll be working really hard and backing ourselves to deliver those
   0.14  0  We run a portfolio of opportunities on a continuous basis and on a step basis, in terms of innovation and then smaller capital options
   0.12  0 So we're always looking at ways to best bank to be had for our buck, and for the time, these 2 guys, they're spending on improving the business
   0.20  0 So we keep that portfolio running, so it's across a range of opportunities, depending on where we see the markets going at any one particular time
   0.17  0 So that's our job, to look at everything we can see, and then allocate our resources to the best opportunities
   0.20  0 Also the ANC's going to win a general election next year
   0.00  1 The one thing that I think characterizes Anglo American is the quality of the assets we've got across the globe
   0.00  1 And we've made that very clear
   0.00 -1 And the elements that were in that charter document, from our perspective, didn't provide a climate for returns
   0.00 -1 And I think the toughest thing for the President is the expectations that are being built up and the expectations over a very short period of time
   0.33  0 How fast will it be, or how far would it go depends where prices are and all that sort of thing
   0.00 -1 So a little hard to exactly forecast
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -0.50  0 Second question, just on Minas-Rio
   0.00 -1 In terms of goods, last year, there was about 3 million carats for us, very early in the year that were sold, so obviously, impacts the quality
  -0.07  0 On a production basis there, you're right in pointing out that Gahcho Kué and Orapa will drop the headline quality number, but also remember their low cost carat
  -0.05  1 So even though the carat, the quality number or the pricing that we get for those carats will drop, and we don't like to put a number on that because obviously, there are commercial negotiations that go on, so we don't to flag where we are, but we still think they're wonderful products
   0.00  1 From our point of view, they will have an impact, but certainly, our margins are in good shape, because they're lower cost carats as well
   0.00  1  In terms of Minas-Rio, the important thing for the final approval at the end of this year, means that this year the production's reasonably flat
   0.33 -1 That's an opportunity not yet realized
   0.15  0 The debate is, obviously,   should you take a bit more of a great project, or should you balance that and take some profits early? That's the debate with the Board that we'll have at the mid-year
  -0.14  0  An unfortunate suggestion, please limit your questions, we have 2 maximum, please
  -0.20  0 And then second one, just wondering if Stuart might be willing to answer a question, coming into the organization and the industry from outside, what do you see as your key priorities in terms of guiding the Board, and what are the key challenges for Anglo to be addressing over the next few years?  So I'll go with the Minas question first
   0.00  1 Good news is, the quality looks good
   0.00  1 So we think the project is well placed for the long term
   0.00  1 At the moment, we're actually delivering cash flow
   0.00 -1 Our costs, I think, are about 15% below what you would've normally expected at this sort of volume
  -0.50  0 Thank you for the question
   0.00  1 It's interesting that the Board delightfully continues to challenge itself and beat itself up about what are doing everything we can and we're doing the right thing
   0.00  1 And I think that's a really, really important thing to do
   0.00  1 And I was pleased to see Mark talking very early on about how disappointed we are in our safety performance
   0.00  1 In terms of priorities going forward, other than those, run things the best you can
  -0.09  0 And that's the most important thing, you can -- it's clear to me, you can't market or talk your way out of a fundamental cost curve problem
  -0.50  0 Just 2 questions, one clarification
   0.00  1 What he is doing is making sure that we've got some flexibility in how we respond to the market
   0.00  1 Because we don't want to bring that capacity on today, when the market's still reasonably well balanced
  -0.12  0 So it's a phasing issue as opposed to an absolute quantity issue, first point
  -0.06  1 One of the difficult issues we have is that with the change of government, the senior management of CODELCO changes, but they're certainly been a good base established now, so we're going to continue working that through, and we think that's important
   0.00 -1 And we think those arguments, but that need major capital leaks, in terms of delivery of improvement, by reduced water consumption, which is a no-brainer in that sort of environment
   0.00  1 So we think, any partner we have in an asset that is sensible and rational and wants to make a lot in terms of returns, would consider those opportunities, but it's up to us to build the case, and we think we can
  -1.00  0 Two questions, if I could
   0.00  1 So you've upped your guidance in terms of production
  -0.25  0 The second question is outside South Africa, I mean, obviously, political changes there
   0.12  0 Obviously, the great dike there is this really significant, sort of PGM resource
   0.00 -1 When you say it quickly, it doesn't sound like much
   0.00  1 And the focus on equipment productivity, I think, we're up by a factor of 150% on our major shovels now
   0.00 -1 So the reason we're delivering additional tonnage is: one, the big change in the mine; and two, the underlying productivities of the equipment, we're operating track, it used to be 4,000 hours a year, it's now 6,000 hours, so our sustainable capital is also going down
   0.00  1 So it's sustainable right -- it's a sustainable right pull
   0.08  0 What Tony and Seamus and the team are working on now, what are the new technologies to try and enhance that resource space and build more life in the asset
   0.05  0 So yes, we're working closely with Transnet, who provide the rail, and so making sure we're as efficient as we can onto the train, down the train line and in and through the port, is a real area of focus for us, even though we don't own and operate all of that aspect, but we are bumping up against some of those capacity constraints
   0.08  0 And so, obviously then, the focus for improvement can be around grade and quality and which tonnes you do move down the lines, so we've got all those options in front of us
   0.00  1 So again, underlying productivity improves have been quite significant in the operations
   0.00  1 So they've done a very, very good job
   0.10  0 So we'll continue to nurture Unki, I know Chris [indiscernible] has mastered, in terms of the quality of the resource effect
   0.08  0 I think both Chris and Tony agree, it's a great resource, but we'd like to see a lot more color buoy before we think about taking any further steps
  -0.17  0 We know the first quarter is always quite important for the midstream where they make their decisions
  -0.25  0 Another question on the working capital
   0.09  0 And in fact, the financial reporting transparency piece that we have put in place is designed to identify and help us identify where those things may have occurred
   0.00  1 Two, the mood generally has been pretty good
  -0.33  1 And the mood coming back has been quite strong
   0.20 -1 I've learned in this business not to get too excited by one or two sites, so
   0.00  1 But so far, so good
   0.00  1 And certainly, the feedback's been pretty solid
   0.00  1 And I think the commitment ourselves have made, and are also to the creditors made, those programs are going to be very important in making sure our product is front and center in terms of consumer choices
   0.20  0 I suppose, broadly happy with where the levels are at today
   0.04  0 So we've been progressively doing a number of things, extending the maturity, shaping the profile of maturities and also then looking at how we think about both the cash we have on hand, the undrawn facilities, and as we get control over our CapEx as we get certainty over our cost performance and cash flow, just bringing all those things down and progressively just tightening up and that don't all come for free
  -0.12  1 And so, yes, we can save, let's say, $100 million as we work through that strategy to tighten those things up
  -0.40  0 I'll take one more question, and then we'll go to South Africa for a question
   0.00  1 I guess, the results from all of the companies have sort of shown that having amazingly, a strong balance sheet is no longer a scarce thing
   0.07  0 So any thoughts about recycling that capital into another opportunity, to sort of keep the total exposure, but just to have it structured in a more different way?  I'll let Stephen have first crack, then I'll have a view as well
   0.15  0 And some of it is about how do we think about our balance sheet both in this opportunity and for the suite of other opportunities that may emerge largely within our existing portfolio or from without, and making sure that we do have that flexibility through all parts of the cycle, without overstretching on any 1 particular project or locking ourselves out with other value-creating opportunities
   0.08  0 So we think about all the things you would expect, CapEx, cash flow, returns, other opportunities, sovereign risk, et cetera, et cetera
   0.20  0 So they all are factoring into our decision, and will help inform where we eventually land
   0.00  1 In the end, we've learned a lot of lessons from Minas-Rio
   0.00  1 So it's a strategic choice in the first instance
   0.25  0 It would have been a lot more easy to handle if we had shared some of that risk
   0.09  0 And so again, we've got Duncan and Tony and the guys, absolute brilliant work on Quellaveco, but there are still things we don't know, we don't know
  -0.08  0 And I think, secondly, when we've got capital -- when we've got the business, the allocation model is absolutely critical
  -0.08  0 So debt, dividend, investment in the right places, and every dollar of capital goes through a stringent justification, competition stage guiding process
   0.13  0 And also obviously, you have partner there that was looking to sell out their share, but it doesn't look like they are going to right now, so just some thoughts on that, please?  Yes, certainly, Quellaveco is the most advanced
   0.00  1 But I think as you broaden the -- for people to understand, we've got other options, but the team's got to demonstrate delivery, getting the margins, delivering on cash flow
   0.11  0 And that was the point we wanted to make is, we've got a portfolio of opportunities that will compete for capital
   0.10  0 And we're certainly not on the -- we've certainly not got it at the stores ready to go, just making a point of opportunity
  -0.17  0  I could just take other questions in the -- we'll just have the other questions in the roundtable, please
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.00  1 Very much appreciate your participation
   0.00  1 And again, focus on the assets, capabilities and making sure that we continue to hold our discipline in terms of delivering returns
   0.00  1 Thank you

---FILE: Antofagasta plc.txt

   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.20  0 And finally, I will close with our guidance for the year, and then I'll open it up for questions
   0.17  0 So let me start then by drawing your attention to some of the important achievements that we had during 2017
   0.00  1 We think we've had a strong performance last year, and that's one of the highlights of our results, strong momentum which we expect to carry on into this year
  -0.29  1 So first of all, I would like to say that we have in '17 achieved our goal of 0 fatalities and have had no serious accident for almost now 2 years, 24 months
   0.00  1 This is our first priority, and therefore, this is something that we have been working very hard to maintain as a record
   0.00  1 And we'll continue to be very focused on continuing to sustain this very good performance
   0.00  1 We had a solid performance financially
   0.00  1 Our EBITDA was up 59% against last year to $2.6 billion
   0.00  1 Operating cash flow, at $2.5 billion, was 70% up compared to the prior year
   0.00  1 This is on the back of higher copper price, higher sales volume but also tighter cost management
   0.00  1 These allowed us to reduce our net debt by $615 million, which brings our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 2.2x -- 0.2x
   0.00 -1 We also completed, in respect of our projects, the Encuentro Oxide project last year, which, at the cost of $605 million, was, in fact, $30 million below our budget
   0.00  1 We are committed to keeping our financial discipline and delivering shareholder returns
  -0.14  0 And we will only pursue [ value-accretive ] growth and return any excess cash to shareholders
   0.00  1 In line with this, the board has recommended a total dividend for this year of $0.509 per share or $502 million, which corresponds to 177% increase on last year's dividend
   0.00  1 So in summary, a strong operating performance in 2017; and financially, something which we plan to sustain the momentum through this year
  -0.06  0 We then consider capital investment in development options with a strict focus on returns, with any excess cash returned to shareholders, typically, by paying a larger dividend
  -0.14  1 Safety is always our first priority, and we will work hard in ensuring that our fatality-free record continues
   0.00  1 This year, we expect to see a 3% increase in production, and therefore, this is the focus of our operational performance
   0.00  1 Finally, during the year, we expect to take the Los Pelambres incremental expansion project to be approved by the board, adding 55,000 tonnes per annum of copper while also reducing mine's cost
  -0.05  0 Finally, then at the end of the year, we will determine the level of our excess cash based on the factors set out in our previous slide, we talked about our capital framework -- capital allocation framework, and then distribute this to shareholders
   0.00  1 However, as I've stressed before, we'll always place value and profitable growth over volume in deciding on which projects to invest
   0.00  1 We want to keep our strong operating performance momentum this year
   0.00  1 We have a first quarter with a lower grade, but that's going to turn around, and we see increased grades in the year so that the year will end up with a similar grade as last year
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.00  1 Well, firstly, I would like to quickly recap on our solid operating performance in 2017, which were announced in January
   0.00  1 While we reached our production guidance for the year, we exceeded expectation on net cash cost
   0.25 -1 We are particularly satisfied with the Los Pelambres performance
   0.00  1 Throughput was up due to its sustained high plant availability
   0.09  0 Additionally, Los Pelambres proposed and agreed a compliance program with the environmental regulator to resolve the charges made in 2016
   0.00  1 Okay, let's move on our financials, and let's start by looking at our revenue, which rose by 31.1% to $4.7 billion for the year
   0.00  1 This increase was primarily due to the increase in the realized copper price, which averaged $3 per pound during the year, 29% higher than in 2016
   0.00  1 The moly price was also strong in 2017, and it's currently trading at about $13 per pound, which is a good time to bring the Centinela moly plant onstream
   0.00  1 Los Pelambres increased group cash costs by $0.04; and Centinela, by $0.02, as grade decreased at both concentrate operations
   0.00  1 By-product credits were $0.35 per pound for the year, slightly higher than in 2016, which brought our net cash cost to $1.25 per pound
   0.00  1 Over the last 4 years, while we have been running our Cost and Competitiveness Programme, we have reduced our gross cash costs by 13% despite our average grade declining by 16% during the same period
   0.00  1 This is a saving of almost $525 million of annual mine-site cost
   0.00  1 EBITDA rose by $960 million or nearly 60% to $2.6 billion in 2017
   0.00  1 This was driven primarily by the higher copper price
   0.00  1 Mining costs have also increased because copper sales volume have increased
   0.00  1 Our associate and joint venture have also contributed to the increase, with EBITDA $52 million higher than in 2007 -- '16, mainly due to Zaldívar
   0.00  1 As Iván mentioned earlier, in 2017, our EBITDA margin has increased strongly and has returned to over 50%, and we aim to maximize this margin
   0.00  1 This will increase to $1 billion this year as sustaining CapEx capital increases by $150 million, explaining by a concentration of scheduled mine fleet replacement and tailing dams with [ enlargement costs ]
  -0.08  0 And although we quote this figure on an annual basis, it is more appropriately considered, on a rolling average basis, our sustaining CapEx is irregular year-on-year
   0.00  1 As mentioned earlier, higher EBITDA contributed very strongly to this year cash generation
   0.00  1 Our cash balance at the end of 2017 was $204 billion higher -- $204 million (sic) [ $203 million ] higher than last year after paying nearly $500 million of scheduled debt repayment and $900 million in capital expenditure plus various other outflows
   0.00  1 These are our large copper asset base, our focus on costs and our capital discipline
  -0.17  0 This lie at the heart of our business and offer us a significant range of options
   0.00  1 This is the root of our organic growth
   0.00  1 We are committed to maintaining our financial discipline
   0.00  1 We have low debt levels and have a flexible and robust balance sheet
   0.00  1 Discipline in everything we do is key, and we have discipline
   0.00  1 Thank you very much
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1 So on the market, I think -- I mean, 2017 was a good year for the copper market
   0.00  1 We saw -- or have -- and are seeing synchronized global growth, especially in the major economies and continuing growth in emerging economies, particularly in China, which is very important for the copper demand
   0.00  1 And for copper, this is an equally strong trend as copper is widely used in consumable and durable goods, which is the fastest-growing category as average income rise and discretionary spending increases
   0.00  1 We expect that copper demand in China will grow at rates between 2% and 3% annually from the very large base of consumption today
   0.00  1 And I think if you look back at 2017, probably physical copper demand in China did surprise us to the upside
   0.11  0 The information on data we've gathered so far in the field is that's probably been closer to 4%
   0.00  1 So that's been a good piece of good news
   0.00  1 And conservative estimates would suggest that this can actually increase to around 2 million tonnes by 2030
  -0.12  1 So it's a tenfold increase in a tight market that's quite significant
   0.00 -1 So on the supply side, we expect to continue to see a constrained market
   0.00 -1 Another feature of copper which we know well is a declining grade, which means that an equivalent of a mid-sized mine actually is taken out of production every year despite that everybody continues producing, and therefore, this is an element which is important in our industry cost curve and has been in the past
  -0.07  0 And what's happened there is that we have submitted a contract proposal; and after some negotiation period, it has been voted against; and therefore, where we're into now is a period of mediation, which involves a further space for negotiation and agreement
  -0.17  0 Obviously, if there is agreement, then we will enter into a new contract at the end of that period
   0.00  1 And I think without, as I say, preempting the outcome of that process, we have a history of good labor relationships in Antofagasta
   0.12  0 In 2016, we finished the construction of Antucoya, our newest greenfield project, which is now producing at full capacity
   0.00 -1 On 2017, this past year, Encuentro Oxides came into production below budget
   0.00 -1 We were $30 million below budget
  -0.08  0 These recent investments through what has essentially been the downturn of the cycle will now account for about 25% of our total production and will make a significant contribution, therefore, to our business
  -0.12  0 At the same time, as we have been investing in mining projects, we have been divesting of some of our non-mining assets
  -0.11  0 And in 2016, we disposed of our interest in Alto Maipo, reducing the cost of its long-term PPA with the Los Pelambres
  -0.18  1 We have the Phase 1 of the incremental expansion, where we will seek to maximize throughput within the existing tailings and waste disposal permits
   0.07  0 The project capital estimate has recently been updated with current pricing projection, advanced detail engineering and a project execution plan to a revised estimate of $1.3 billion
   0.00  1 This is the first phase to unlock further value at Los Pelambres, which is a low- cost, expandable, world-class asset with close to 6 billion tonnes of resource equivalent, 3x the current mine plan
   0.00  1 Subsequent to this, the Phase 2 is a further throughput expansion to 205,000 tonne a day, which will increase tailings and water dump capacities, extending now the mine of a life (sic) [ life of mine ] by about   15 years and adding 35,000 tonnes of copper a year
  -0.08  1 So Phase 1, within the existing waste and tailings dam permits; Phase 2 will extend the mine life on what we think is one of the best in the world
   0.14 -1 We think this would be a lower CapEx and lower construction and project execution risk project
   0.00  1 But just to recap, in 2018, we are expecting a 3% increase in production -- in copper production against last year, 2017
   0.00  1 During the year, you will see our production start low -- on lower grades and grow quarter-by-quarter
   0.00  1 And at the same time, our costs will decrease to reach the annual figures I've just given
   0.00  1 So going back then to this year's priorities, we want to sustain our strong operating momentum in this 2018
   0.00  1 Zero fatalities comes first, and therefore, achieving 0 fatalities and keeping that record is paramount in our business; delivering on guidance, a 3% copper production increase against 2017; achieving more gains in productivity and savings, we think, irrespective of where we are in the price cycle productivity and safety is something we will never stop working and focusing on; successfully completing labor negotiations at Los Pelambres, as we've said, we've got that ongoing at the moment and mediation; advancing both the Los Pelambres and Centinela expansion projects to the next decision points; and then distributing excess cash to shareholders according to our capital allocation framework
   0.00  1 As I say, in summary, we think we've had a good performance -- strong performance last year and expect to continue keeping that momentum
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -0.13  0 And can you make a comment on whether the rail business still definitely remains core within the portfolio?  Okay, let me take the second 2 questions, and you take the tax question, Alfredo
   0.12  0 And therefore, we are working, hopefully, towards an outcome which will be beneficial for both parties, but I can't comment on the specifics
  -0.07  0 So they're open to use by other parties, and therefore, we've thought of them as being eligible for, therefore, disposals so that someone else can use capital, basically, in that type of more infrastructure-like investment
   0.00  1 With respect to the rail, the rail is doing very well
   0.00  1 It's as -- it's an -- a business which is very much tied to the origins of our company; good results in 2017
  -0.20  0 Well, about the tax cuts, we received a $130 million tax refund during 2017
   0.14  0 $130 million of them were received effectively during 2017, of course, offsetting part of the tax cash outflow for this year
  -0.17  0 So also, this figure will have some impact in the tax cuts in 2018, but this is basically the reason behind
   0.08  0  Yes, effective tax rate is in the region of 35%, and we don't have any extraordinary or special event or factor affecting the tax situation of the company
   0.20  0 Is that fair?  The tax cash for '18 should be stabilized in terms of the tax ratio
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions from me
   0.00  1 And then secondly, just on working capital, I mean, you've done a good job at sort of squeezing working capital out of the business in the last few years
  -0.14  0  There was -- there were quite a big -- big swings in, actually, inventories and receivables
  -0.12  0 I mean, on the costs side, the question was around the labor negotiation impact on cost
   0.08  0 On receivables, you know that, that depend on the sales volume and the copper price evolution because all of our receivable terms continue to be exactly the same, no change in this space
   0.17  0 It relates to the fact that we've advanced the lever of engineering
   0.09  0 In terms of the project execution risk, with the construction, we've also worked hard at looking into that and built the contingencies into that estimate
   0.08  0 There is an element of price update as well, but I would say that most of it has to do with the fact that we de-risked the execution, advancing the engineering and doing the front-end loading
   0.14  0 We think Pelambres, I mean, it's our greatest asset in terms of our portfolio
   0.00  1 This is a strong project, and therefore, we're very keen on getting this off the ground
   0.00  1 We're also very keen on meeting our guidance, as we've done in production and cost, and therefore, we think of our estimate update in those terms as well to be in line with what we communicate
   0.00  1 We've got the environmental permit, which I think is good
   0.11  0 That's something that we take for granted, but in fact, it's not easy for projects to get the environmental permit
   0.00  1 And in fact, in this case, it was unanimously, they voted in favor, so I think -- which means also that from a community point of view, we think we're in good shape to undertake the project
  -0.50  0 Some of them are sort of new out of the changes in the law but nothing of a major concern
  -0.11  0 So we're not going to deviate from that principle, and we'll look at different options in their own merit as they come
  -0.25  0 Two quick ones from me, just extending on Jason's questions
  -0.33  0 Or will this now, with the excess capacity, cover this?  Okay
  -0.20  0 And that desalination plant is sized such that it will serve the needs for water of Phase 1 and Phase 2 and also, eventually, as a backup facility for the existing operation in case there is a drought or continuing drought or severe drought
  -0.12  0 And secondly, just on Reko Diq, you mentioned about the multibillion dollar potential claim
   0.11  0 Any progress or anything that's moved on that part?  Sorry, I didn't get the last one
  -0.14  0  On Reko Diq, you mentioned about a potential multibillion dollar claim
   0.07  0 One of the main enablers of this, just to mention, is the fact that we can use the tailings deposit that we have today, so we can synergize with existing infrastructure, avoiding, therefore, incremental investments that we would otherwise have to make in the second concentrator
   0.08  0 The second concentrator is expected to be built, when it's built, around 7 kilometers away from the existing plant and, therefore, needs also a tailings deposit to be constructed
   0.00  1 We've done our first pass as -- at those studies, and those are favorable
  -0.08  0 And we really want to focus then on clearing any flaw which may exist so that we can then move this into a proper feasibility in the course of the end -- by the end of this year
   0.07  0 I mean, we're seeing this as an option that's got less front-end capital for the development of the district, and therefore, it ties in well with our principle of using capital as efficiently as possible
  -0.22  1 And the outcome of the first phase of that arbitration was favorable to the company, claiming that the permits had been taken without -- or in -- not in accordance with the contracts
  -0.67  0 Just a question -- a couple of questions
  -0.17  0 And then secondly on that, just if you could provide a breakdown in terms of sensitivity to the Chilean peso
   0.06  0 And finally, in terms of CapEx guidance for this year, the $1 billion, could you provide a bit of clarity in terms of what proportion of that is domestic versus international cost base and, again, any sensitivity around strengthening of FX?  Yes
   0.00 -1 So we -- when we look at costs, I mean, if you look at our performance last year, we did see inflation exchange rate and input price pressure
   0.00  1 Around 65% of those pressures we were able to compensate through cost reductions
  -0.33  0  Just a follow-up question on the question earlier about Quellaveco
   0.07  0 Given your comment around that, that you would focus on returns, does that mean, going forward, you would be happy to take a non- operatorship role in re-sharing projects?    As operators, we bring something to the table
   0.00 -1 And I think in the case of Zaldívar, costs have come down
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of questions
   0.11  0 Firstly, on the balance sheet, obviously, you've put these pressures up more or less into a net cash position now
  -0.06  0 And then the second question is, just going back to the Los Pelambres expansion CapEx and the desal plant there, should we assume that there's no CapEx requirement for the desal plant in Phase 2 as things stand at present?  On the second one, the answer is yes
   0.00 -1 Probably as we're seeing   things today, that -- we think that's probably high, and therefore, we wouldn't go that far
   0.00  1 But that's the sort of flexibility that we see in our balance sheet, but we want to keep the strength of our financial condition as a key cornerstone of the strategy of this company because that has served us well through good times and bad times
   0.00  1 Don't forget that during the downturn, and memories is -- we've managed to continue to grow our businesses through the Encuentro Oxide; Antucoya, we purchased; Zaldívar, and we're benefiting from that now
   0.20  0 So that's part of our strategy, not to be caught in that position
  -0.25  0 I just had one question on grade variability
   0.09  0 And therefore, a lot of the work that we've been certainly doing has been acquiring information to be able to have the sort of visibility that you're suggesting is necessary
   0.00  1  Yes, I would say in the case of Pelambres, it's quite smooth in terms of performance
  -0.25  0 Just one quick question on your cost guidance
   0.00 -1 There's   one key part of your cost -- I mean, TC/RCs, however, are trending down
  -0.25  0 Or are you here locked in into longer-term contracts?  The TC/RC gets restated every year, and we have not changed that practice
  -0.06  0 It depends on what the quantity is committed, which get designated on a quarterly basis is -- so I mean, the bulk goes into contracts, which are term contracts, even though the TC/RCs get reset every year
  -0.20  0 Just one question on Los Pelambres versus Centinela
  -0.08  0 Phase 2 is a lower investment, but it's a bit more complex from a permitting point of view because it does involve more tailings and waste space
   0.07  0 But I think if you -- if we progress according to our time line, we probably will be facing the choice of Phase 2 at Pelambres and Centinela alternative case at a similar time
   0.12  0 And I think it will depend on the feasibility that we see at that stage of undertaking one against the other, which will dictate what we'll do
   0.00  1 Okay, well, thank you very much
  -1.00  0 Any questions from the..
   0.00  1 Thank you very much, and we'll see you during the day
   0.00  1 Thank you

    nan  1  Very good
    nan  1 Good
   0.00  1 All right, good afternoon, everybody
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 2
  -0.11  0 [Operator Instructions] There's also an option to ask questions online as part of the webcast
  -0.22  0 Please limit yourself to one question in the first round, if you don't mind, so everybody can get a chance to ask a question
   0.00  1 Thank you so much
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 4
   0.00  1 These are the highlights of the year
   0.00  1 We had accelerated goals in the last quarter, and it bodes well for 2018
  -0.05  1 And those are slowly ramping up, in particular Imfinzi, but Tagrisso also is starting to accelerate on the back of our first-line data, which of course we don't promote, but some physicians, in particular in the U.S., are already starting to adopt in their daily practice
   0.00  1 And the Fasenra launch is proceeding very well, very early days of course
   0.00  1 We launched in November in the U.S., as you know, but so far, so good
   0.00  1 The Emerging Markets are clearly a nice story, in particular for China
   0.00  1 We experienced a growth rate of 8%, acceleration in Q4
  -0.33  0 An example is the anesthetics divestment
  -0.17  1 So the actual growth rate of those countries is higher than we report if you correct for this
   0.00  1 I'm not suggesting a minute that the growth rate will be higher in Q4 but certainly more to come in term of products
   0.00  1 So that certainly will fuel our growth
   0.00  1 Tagrisso is doing very well
   0.00 -1 And we would not have seen that 5 years ago simply because the cost was a hurdle
   0.00  1 For 2018, we guided to a single-digit percentage increase in product sales
   0.00 -1 The patent expired in Europe for Crestor later than the U.S., and therefore, there's still an impact in that region as well as in Japan
   0.00  1 We were ranked 34 in the Corporate Knights' 14th annual Global 100 list of the most sustainable companies in the world
   0.00  1 We had very rich news flow in the last part of the year
   0.00  1 approval in breast cancer, which is really a major milestone demonstrating the benefit of PARP inhibition outside of ovarian cancer
   0.00  1 Within ovarian cancer, we received approval for Lynparza in Japan in the second-line setting
   0.14  0 Tagrisso really led the way, and we're trying to achieve now the same ways with Lynparza
  -0.11  1 And as a result, we received break-through therapy designation for first-line use in the U.S
   0.00  1 In CVMD, we received some really, really good news for ZS-9
   0.14  0 And you've probably seen that in Europe the CHMP has now completed their inspection of the plant and through their satisfaction
   0.00  1 We got approval to launch Fasenra in the U.S
  -0.50  0 for severe and uncontrolled asthma
   0.00  1 The rest of the portfolio is growing nicely
  -0.17  1 ZS-9 was a temporary setback, and hopefully, we should get approval soon, as I said
  -0.25  0 And there's of course, the MYSTIC setback
  -0.33  0 We still have to -- PFS setback, I should say
   0.00 -1 We're still waiting for the overall survival results in the first half of this year
  -0.25  0 We had 3 setbacks: [indiscernible], ZS-9 and MYSTIC
   0.12  0 So it really gives you a sense of the sheer scale of the pipeline progression we've experienced in 2017
   0.00  1 This shows you that we are definitely committed to returning the company to growth
   0.14 -1 As a not-so-exciting reminder, we've had no growth since 2010 as we went through all those patent expiries
   0.00 -1 You know that, but it's certainly a reminder of the kind of transition we've gone through and the headwinds we've been experiencing for all these years
   0.00  1 For the first time, in Q4, we experienced growth, not a lot of growth but certainly growth
  -0.25  0 Lynparza, Imfinzi, so as you can see here, quite a lot
  -0.14  1 That is slowing us down, but overall the -- our expectation for 2018 is that the positive should offset -- more than offset the negative
   0.00  1 And we expect low single-digit growth rate in product sales
   0.00  1 And welcome, everybody
   0.00  1 The growth platforms delivered overall growth in the year of 6% with the strong acceleration during Q4 driven by continued volume growth; and true-ups, favorable true-ups, for -- in the U.S
   0.00  1 And also, we saw good momentum, as Pascal mentioned, in Emerging Markets but also in New CVMD and in New Oncology
   0.33  0   Turn to Slide 12, please
   0.00  1 Now as we're going forward this year and as we increase our focus on commercial execution, we're going to start to share growth from our main therapeutic areas in this new format
   0.50  0 Next slide, please
   0.00  1 Emerging market growth continues to be in line with the long-term performance target of mid- to high single-digit growth in product sales with 8% sales growth for the year
   0.00  1 And that contributed to an overall growth in the year of 15%
   0.00  1 In -- also importantly in Emerging Markets, the growth was driven by our core growth platforms, our core therapeutic areas, which all delivered double-digit growth across Emerging Markets
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 14
   0.00  1 In 2017, Emerging Markets performance was significantly impacted by divestments, so therefore, the underlying performance in China and Emerging Markets was actually even stronger than was reported
   0.00  1 Excluding the effects of divestment, China demonstrated 18% and 22% growth in 2016 and 2017, and x China growth would be 7% and 10%
   0.00  1 It's also worth to note that the growth in China in the fourth quarter was absolutely driven by durable demands growth as sales were not impacted by inventory movements
   0.25  0 So slide -- turn to Slide 15, please
   0.00 -1 Symbicort product sales were down by 6% in the year with the flat quarter partly driven by favorable sales true-up adjustment in the U.S., as I mentioned but also certainly by overall continued increase in volume
   0.00  1 Importantly, in the U.S
   0.00  1 NBRx, new-to-brand prescriptions, has been growing actually for Symbicort since September
  -0.22  1 And this was driven by an increase in share of voice, by the expanded exacerbations label -- COPD exacerbations, and the launch of a new campaign
   0.00  1 Symbicort continued to grow in Emerging Markets and delivered 10% growth this year
   0.00  1 And Pulmicort also continued to demonstrate robust growth, up 12% in the year, driven by Emerging Markets with a fourth quarter performance of 26%
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 16
   0.50  0 Next slide, please
   0.50  0 Next slide, please
   0.00  1 In Japan, we continue to grow, with product sales up 4%
   0.00  1 That's despite a declining Japanese market
   0.00  1 Growth was mainly driven by Forxiga, a new indication for Faslodex and Forxiga
   0.00  1 And actually the performance of our team in Japan is really outstanding
   0.33  0 And we do anticipate this effect to continue throughout 2018
   0.00  1 And so really outstanding performance by the team in Japan
   0.22  0 And on that note, it's a great pleasure to hand over to Dave to take you through the oncology growth platform
   0.00  1 Thanks, everyone
   0.00  1 Good afternoon, everyone
   0.00  1 So this now represents 20% of total AstraZeneca product sales, and that's growth of 19% year- over-year 2017 versus 2016
   0.10  0 And we look across these, and I'll talk about it in greater detail, but we see truly global launches with both Lynparza and Tagrisso
   0.00  1 And those are catalysts for next year
   0.00  1 And we look forward to that continuing strong growth in the next year
   0.33  0 If we could turn to the next slide, please
   0.00  1 I want to go through and talk about what has really been strong performance there as well
   0.00  1 For the quarter, globally, we saw $100 million in sales, which results in full year sales of $297 million with really very strong growth, as you can see on the slide, across all regions
   0.00  1 And it's underpinned by truly strong growth in the second half of the year within the U.S
   0.00  1 What we saw from that is, once the handicap of the pill burden and also the narrower label were lifted with the SOLO-2 approval, that we really began to increase our competitiveness within the ovarian cancer space
   0.00  1 And we see 74% growth within the quarter within the U.S
   0.00  1 BRCA testing rates have been moving nicely
   0.00  1 We look forward to that being a catalyst going forward in 2018
   0.33  0   If we could turn to Slide 21, please
   0.00  1 This is predominantly driven by second line and higher testing rates that we've seen across all of the markets that we're in
   0.00  1 59% growth over the year, testing rates now over 70%
   0.00  1 And we see continued growth as we prepare for first line
   0.00  1 We also saw very strong growth in Europe, up 142% over the year
   0.00 -1 The testing rates in Europe are somewhat below what we see within the U.S
   0.00  1 And then lastly, Pascal spoke about China and what we've had in terms of really an outstanding early penetration into that market
   0.00  1 In the meanwhile, we've been quite pleased to see that within bladder cancer, our labeled indication, we are now third in the market in terms of market share with low double-digit market share
  -0.33  1 And I think that speaks to the competitiveness of our field force
   0.00  1 So in summary, if you put together what you've heard from both Mark Mallon, Pascal and myself, we have now a pipeline transformation that is continuing to deliver
   0.00  1 The extensive portfolio across our 3 main therapy areas has the potential to deliver several blockbuster medicines
   0.00  1 We remain committed to ensuring all eligible patients get access to our treatments as quickly as possible
   0.20  0 And with this, it's my pleasure to turn over to Marc Dunoyer to go through some of our financials
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 And hello, everyone
   0.33  0 If you could please turn to Slide 24
   0.00  1 Product sales, however, grew by 3% in the quarter, which included favorable true-up adjustment related to the first 9 months of 2017
  -0.07  1 The reported tax rate of minus 29% in the year reflected a favorable net adjustment of $617 million to defer taxes driven by the recently reduced U.S
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 25
   0.00 -1 Our gross margin ratio for the year fell by 1 percentage point to 81.2% driven primarily by product mix effects, including the decline of [ sets ] of medicine where we have lost exclusivity as well as a ramp-up of manufacturing capacity for new medicines
   0.12  0   To remind you: we book all Lynparza and Tudorza product sales and reflect the product profit share within cost of sales
   0.00  1 Core R&D and SG&A costs each reduced by 3% in the year
   0.00  1 We did, however, see an uplift in core SG&A cost in the second half driven by some specific factors, which I'll talk about in a moment
  -0.12  1 Core operating -- other operating income increased by 14% in the year, a result of the level of disposal activity
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 26
   0.06  0 Looking at external revenue in more detail, I want to turn to the contribution of ongoing externalization revenue, which includes royalties, option payments, milestone payments and profit sharing
   0.00  1 Over time, we expect to see this ratio possibly rising further
   0.12  0 The collaboration with Merck is expected to provide a significant amount of income in the years to come
  -0.10  0 We recognize about $1.2 billion in external revenue from Merck in the year and a further cash inflow of $600 million deferred against future R&D investment
   0.11  0 As mentioned previously, the agreement also included payments by Merck of $750 million for certain license option over 2017 to 2019 and up to $6.15 billion contingent upon successful achievement of approval and sales milestone for both monotherapy and combinations; we received the first option payment of $250 million
  -0.09  0 We're also committed to the constant management of our portfolio disposal and to increasing the focus on our 3 main therapy areas over time
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 27
  -0.09  0 Core R&D cost declined by 3% with Oncology continuing to occupy the largest part of investment at 44% of the total
   0.08  0 CVMD and Respiratory again enjoyed around 1/4 of the R&D budget each with only a nominal level of funding allocated outside the 3 main therapy areas
   0.00  1 In 2018, core SG&A cost are expected to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 28
   0.00  1 We know we have more work to do to drive our underlying cash flow
  -0.08  1 We do anticipate growth in product sales and expect a reduction in restructuring cost to accompany our focus on cost discipline
   0.33  0   Please turn to Slide 29
   0.00  1 We anticipate low single-digit percentage growth in product sales in 2018 at constant exchange rate
   0.00 -1 In 2018, anticipate the sum of external revenue and other income to be less than that of 2017
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.05  0 I'd like to now run through the late-stage pipeline events since the last results announcement and the highlights of recent data presentations, then I'll finish with a look at our upcoming news flow
   0.33  0 Please turn to Slide 31
   0.00  1 In Oncology, Faslodex received approval in the U.S
   0.00  1 we received Lynparza approval for the treatment of germ line BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer from the OlympiAD data, making Lynparza the first PARP inhibitor to be approved beyond the treatment of ovarian cancer
   0.08  0 Tagrisso received Breakthrough Therapy designation in the United States after meeting its PFS primary endpoint in the first-line FLAURA trial
   0.00  1 In CVMD, we received EU approval for the combination of Bydureon and insulin in type 2 diabetes based on the results of the DURATION-7 trial
   0.00  1 In Respiratory, Symbicort received U.S
  -0.12  1 approval for COPD exacerbations, while Fasenra gained approval in the U.S., EU and Japan
  -0.07  1 Lastly, based on strong Phase II trial results for tezepelumab, we initiated a new Phase III trial, NAVIGATOR, in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma
   0.00  1 We're rapidly moving forward with regulatory submissions around the world from strong FLAURA and PACIFIC data
   0.50  0 Next slide, please
  -0.08  0 We look forward to the ETHOS exacerbation trial results in 2019, which will further characterize the role of this potential new treatment for patients with COPD
  -0.33  0 The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented as a late-breaking abstract at ERS
  -0.09  0 Finally, while Fasenra is already approved in severe uncontrolled asthma, our VOYAGER program is evaluating the efficacy and safety in severe COPD
   0.00  1 We believe Fasenra has the potential to be the best-in-class medicine because it's an anti-eosinophil monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-5 receptor, thereby inducing direct and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
   0.33  0 Please turn now to Slide 35
   0.00  1 approval in breast cancer, we expect regulatory submission in the EU for Lynparza in this half and a regulatory decision in Japan in the second half of 2018
  -0.11  0 So I'll try to conclude quickly so we can actually dedicate the full 45 minutes to your questions
   0.00 -1 Essentially the message I'd like to leave with -- leave you with is this has been a hard, long and arduous road over the last 4, 5 years dealing with these patent expiries
   0.00  1 And it's growing extremely rapidly, and there's a lot more to come
   0.00  1 So I think we are really in a good place
   0.00  1 And after this, 2019 and beyond, we really should experience a period of fast growth
  -0.14  0 [Operator Instructions] We'll also take written questions from the webcast
  -0.17  0 Can I please remind everybody to limit questions to one to be fair to all of our callers
  -0.20  0 And I need to speak another 7 seconds so we just finished 45 minutes and we have 45 minutes for questions
   0.00 -1 I'll start off with a financial question from me for Marc, on the one- off income guidance of less than what was achieved in '17
  -0.14  0 What I can say is that we are going to continue with external revenues, and we're going to continue also with other disposals
   0.00 -1 On your second question, the range of the guidance $3.30 to $3.50, the -- there's obviously some uncertainty on the deals we will be able to conclude, but more importantly, we need to see the success behind the launch of our many new products or new formulation and line extensions
  -0.33  0 I have a question on China and the strong uptake
  -1.00  0 Two questions in one
   0.00  1 What I said is that the launch is going very well, and the sales are growing rapidly, and we're getting even reimbursement in some regions or cities already
  -0.25  0 So with that, Mark, you want to cover the marginal question?  Yes
   0.00  1 In terms of additional investments, I would say China is a place where we have a very strong platform already
   0.00  1    That's a good description
  -0.20  0 The first stop was in a city called Wuhan, and I'm sure nobody has heard about Wuhan
   0.00  1 It's medium priority, and it's growing
   0.17  0 It will be a priority in the near future, but it's still a small place." And you get there and the city is booming
   0.20  0 It's completely booming, and it's not in the dark ages
   0.00  1 So there's enormous potential in China
  -0.06  0 I mean, I think that the direct piece to offer on the question that you asked about the penetration rates is that, maybe to put a fine point on Pascal's, is that they're relatively low for Tagrisso
   0.00  1 So the sales and the speed with which we've been able to get sales and to get reimbursement from some regional players has been certainly faster than we've seen with other new products
   0.20 -1 But in terms of the opportunity that still exists in china, there's considerable
   0.00  1 In terms of IRESSA, our more mature, established brands continue to grow in China
   0.00  1 So whereas IRESSA, Faslodex, Zoladex are not part of our growth drivers outside of China; within China, those are all growing in the double digits
  -0.17  0 Take, maybe, one question online, and then we come back to the room, Richard and Andrew
  -0.20  0 Tim Anderson, Tim, do you want to go ahead?  A question on MYSTIC
   0.00  1 Investors often seem to lose sight of the fact that you have a durva mono arm in this trial and a positive that would give you a first-line monotherapy indication alongside KEYTRUDA possibly even in the current year
  -0.17  0 That would seem quite relevant, especially as PACIFIC gets approved in Stage 3
  -0.17  0 And can I just slip in one quick question on tax rate guidance
  -1.00  0 So I guess the first question is for you, Sean
  -0.20  0  Okay, I'll start, Tim, with your MYSTIC question
   0.06  0 With regard to probability of success for the trial, what we know is from KEYTRUDA in very high expressors PL-1 that, that is validated therapeutic hypothesis with a PD-1 in that select like patient group versus chemotherapy
  -0.07  0   What's a little confusing about interpreting the data out in the world was that if you look at the BMS data, it didn't seem to show that same pattern, and it's not 100% clear why that difference between the 2
   0.09  0 We also, as we've said many times, consider overall survival not only the more meaningful endpoint for patients, but actually the endpoint that better captures the benefit of IO treatments, and so that's the final readout and primary endpoint that will readout the first half of this year
   0.50 -1 When we advance in the year, we narrowed down that range from 17% to 19%
   0.00 -1 So I tend to be relatively cautious, and this is why I would prefer to keep the range of 16% to 20% because this is very variable
   0.10  0 The tax rate is a very variable matter depending on various negotiations with various geographies
  -0.06  0 And obviously, your investing behind the launches, but that figure just seemed a bit higher than I would have thought given that you're leveraging some of the -- your existing sales force or those launches need relatively modest investment
   0.00 -1 And of course, this is also costing us money
   0.00  1 The payback is extremely rapid, so we continue doing it
  -0.08  0 But they are -- mostly, it's on the specialized sales forces that we need to launch all our new products, our new formulation or line extension and some additional expenditures in China, I would say
   0.00  1 we guided to -- we guided for low- to mid-single-digit increase
  -0.22  0 Andrew? Marc, your colleagues in oncology normally take the disproportionate amount of the questions on the therapeutic side
   0.00  1 We happen to have taken a view that we think given the certain members of the class and the pending data and declare this could be a substantially undervalued asset
  -0.20  0  Well, you can answer the commercial question and Mark, the development one, if you want, but..
  -0.29  0 But the -- so the heart failure question is we do incorporate an interim analysis into these trials
  -0.08  0 So the Dapa-HF trial Andrew's referring to is a trial of Farxiga for the treatment of heart failure in both diabetics and nondiabetics
   0.33  0 So what it would do is it would enable the use of Farxiga if positive outside of diabetes as well
   0.33  0 And then if they're positive, we announce them otherwise
   0.00  1  So in terms of the potential, I know Mark would caution me to say that we don't provide guidance, but what I can say is we see substantial further opportunity for Farxiga in the class
   0.00  1 Of course, it's $1 billion- plus brand already growing in mid-20s
   0.00  1 That's further upside
   0.20  0 There's still a tremendous room in terms of changing practice
   0.00  1   So this can be a very substantial product
   0.00  1 We're absolutely committed to it across the globe
  -0.14  0  Unfortunately, the countries where SGLT2s are recommended as first after metformin instead of DPP4 are small countries
   0.00  1 But hopefully, with a lot of good work, we'll be able to modify the guidelines
   0.00  1 And if that class becomes first line after metformin, the potential, as Mark said, is enormous
  -0.08  0 We're going to be in heart failure with a variety of products: Farxiga, of course; roxadustat; in kidney disease, LOKELMA; in cardiology, we have Brilinta
   0.00  1 We'll have LOKELMA, and so we really will have a strong portfolio in each of those -- these areas
  -0.25  0 If I can just go back to Richard's question on SG&A
   0.08  0 Marc, you talked about essentially 2 moving parts within SG&A and continued efficiencies in the underlying SG&A versus investments in new projects and new launches
   0.00 -1 There is a general feeling within the market that at some point in the future, the SG&A burden of AstraZeneca will be somewhat lower than it is now
  -0.08  0 How much of the SG&A increase this year is transient versus permanent to give us an idea for the long-run SG&A requirements of the company?  So thank you very much for this very good question
   0.00  1 You have the continued cost discipline of the company, which is obviously impacting SG&A, but also it's done all across the company
   0.00  1 We could say the same on the late-stage development division, they're also doing great efforts on cost discipline and productivity increases
   0.00  1 So this goes all across the company, and obviously, this reduces the cost
  -0.09  0 I've also talked about the launches, and I would say the accumulation of launches that we are confronted to now -- we have 7 products in launch or in launch preparations
   0.00  1 So the good news is we'll be able to experience a fast growth rate as soon as we get out of these patent expiries
  -0.18  0 But by 2019/2020, there's no doubt our ratio will drop, and we want to get to operating margins that are industry -- that are in line with the industry
   0.00 -1 So we definitely need to increase our operating margin
  -0.50  0 There's no question
   0.00 -1 But to minimize the investment at this point in time would actually not maximize the potential of our products
  -0.33  0 If you think about it, we are really not wasting money
   0.00 -1 -- I'll give an example, in the U.S., our Symbicort's share of voice is lower than the competition
   0.00  1 We're driving market share increase, as Marc showed you earlier, in the U.S
  -0.20  0 But this will disappear as those products launch and they start generating sales
   0.00 -1 And we just need to get all these launches to critical mass to become profitable
   0.33  0 But actually, it's profitable, and the profitability is similar to what we get in Europe
   0.00  1 And as we gain critical mass and become even bigger, the profitability would go up, mechanically
   0.00 -1 I missed you a few times
   0.07  0 You've given us, obviously, lots of information by lots of different parts of the businesses, but one of the biggest contributors is the externalization and 22% of EBIT is from nonrecurring externalization
   0.11  0 You've given us guidance for this year, but we need some color going forward as to how quickly the quality of the earnings will improve
  -0.25  0 And then following on from that, we've had billions of dollars worth of disposals over the last 2 or 3 years
   0.10  0 In term of strategically where we're trying to achieve because this all of sorts of deciphering or reading of what we're trying to do is externalization
   0.10  0 I was reading recently an interview by a CEO of a large mining company and he was explaining that they're building the perfect portfolio for them
  -0.22  0 And we are partnering or divesting, partnering new products and sometimes even tail products but -- and divesting all the products that do not fit
   0.00  1 And at some point, that will show up in our growth rate, of course, and leverage across the business
   0.00  1 had a bounce-up in the fourth quarter as well
  -0.29  0 Second question is whether you could help us with the level of depression of the gross margin that you're expecting
  -0.10  0 Would the fourth quarter gross margin of 79.4% be a reasonable guide to look at going forward against the 81%-or-so that we saw for the full year in '17 and then finally, Respiratory question
  -0.10  0 How do you see that competing against the very high level of investment being put by Lilly and Novo into the GLP market?  It's not only 3, it's 4 questions
  -0.12  0 So we should only pick one or -- maybe the first one, I suspect Marc is not going to give you much further detailed response, so maybe I can give you this one
   0.14  0 I think if you look at the overall year 2017, this gives you a good view of the progression of our portfolio
  -0.12  0 Another indication, if you look at which type of products, we don't want to give a product-by-product detail, but what I can say that most of the true-up are concerned -- concern the legacy product and less so for the newer product
  -0.25  0 And then your second question, maybe it was the third, I don't remember
   0.00  1 So I think if you looked at the gross margin level in the second half of 2017, I think it would provide you a good indication for where the gross margin should be in 2018
   0.17  0 It really affects -- the great majority is affecting the legacy products
   0.00  1 And there's still huge unmet need in this category
   0.00  1 The GLP-1 category is growing very fast in the U.S
   0.00  1 This device has been really well appreciated by physicians and patients
   0.00 -1 The feedback in the research that we did before launch and then in the early days of launch is that this is a very competitive device with the leader in the category
   0.25  0 So you're going to have to wait a few more weeks to start to see a clear position
   0.00  1 We've got a very significant sales and medical teams in the U.S
   0.00  1 So the product itself have the potential and then the combination with Farxiga also has potential
   0.00  1 As you know, we have very nice data for that combination
  -0.33  0 I think maybe Dave is waiting for a question
   0.00  1 Tell him how good a job he's doing
  -0.33  0 But now, there's no oncology question
  -1.00  0 So 2 quick questions
  -0.33  0 and Europe?  Well, so here is the answer to my -- a call for oncology question
  -0.17  0 So maybe, Sean, you can cover the MYSTIC and the PACIFIC question because, really, it's a regulatory question in terms of when do we get approval and when can we start promoting
   0.00  1 So the interim question's pretty easy
  -0.12  0 It's very similar to answer that I gave on to Andrew's question about Forxiga
  -0.40  0 That's how PACIFIC turned out being disclosed for PFS, if you may recall
   0.00  1 So if they exceed our expectations considerably, they can read out early
   0.07 -1 I think that if you take a look at the factors that lead into the speed with which you might think about the uptake for PACIFIC, obviously, the label is one element, and we await feedback from the FDA on where that will net out
   0.00  1 We've certainly seen that access has been growing in terms of hospital access within the U.S
   0.00  1 And I think that it speaks volumes to one of the reasons why getting onto the market with bladder was so important because it has allowed us to be able to have that formula access
   0.09  0 So to educate physicians on that, this is different from you're using an agent today, and we're going to replace it with something better
  -0.12  0 We have a lean and mean sales force on this, which we think is appropriately sized for the size of the market that's there
  -0.25  0 The intent to prescribe is over 60% among the physicians that we're speaking to
  -0.25  0 And if I could just squeeze another question, which will be on roxadustat
   0.00  1 In the second line, then you have a relatively good case to potentially get a reimbursement
   0.00  1 And we have IRESSA there that is really doing very well
   0.14  0 And I think Tagrisso second-line T790M was a brilliant example of that
   0.00  1 So we're hopeful that we can engage them but can't give more guidance
  -0.33  0 It feels like there are 2 questions there
   0.12  0 But what I can tell you is in a given period of time, it's easier to get a lot more events on the dialysis patients simply because they're at greater cardiovascular risk
   0.11  0 We do believe that we will have more information on the dialysis patients by virtue of their higher risk going into trial
   0.04  0 I was partly asking because if I understand correctly their different comparators, one, you're trying to show noninferiority to placebo, another one superiority to ESA, so whether that makes it -- whether the different comparator is a different hurdle?  Yes, again, we don't mechanistically have any reason to believe that the comparators are a different hurdle
  -0.05  0 It's more along the lines of what's the appropriate thing noninferior for something that doesn't -- isn't a treatment versus a drug with a current black box warning around this exact endpoint and wanting to show that you don't convey that risk
   0.00  1  So I think without getting into too much detail on the specifics of individual product pricing within China, what I would suggest that if you're looking for a good analog for how China prices move, I think Europe serves as a good one
   0.08  0 I'm so pleased you asked about roxadustat, I mean, I think Sean gave you a sense of both the clinical program is working out and how to think about the outcomes
   0.33  0 There a different type of opportunity
   0.00  1 So dialysis, we think we're going to have, immediately, a very differentiated profile already
   0.00  1 We know the ability to impact hemoglobin is very, very good from the data we've seen in China
   0.00 -1 But basically elevated cardiovascular risk
   0.00  1 So really a strong synergy across
  -0.12  0 Let's move to -- take an online question, Seamus at Leerink
  -0.20  0 I've got 17 questions, of which I'll ask 1
  -0.10  0 You, 4 or 5 years ago, published a real interesting paper that was a remarkably frank analysis of why R&D had been unsuccessful, perhaps, for AstraZeneca
   0.20  0 And you published the framework to try and make it better
  -0.25  0 Sorry, if it sounds like this, that was not the intent
   0.14  0 I think many who leads the [indiscernible] were simply sharing some of the learnings and experience we've had
   0.00  1 And of course, everybody's very proud of the progress we've made, but there was no intent to declare victory
   0.25  0 Sean, do you want to cover this?  Sure, I'm happy to
  -0.14  0 It's not exactly declaring victory, right, because then 80% of the time you still fail
   0.00  1 It's interesting
   0.00  1 I think the lessons are quite transferable, to be perfectly honest
  -0.17  0 If you ask what's different about it, it's not knowing them that's quite so complicated as it is applying them objectively and consistently and not allowing hope to sway you in a place for one of those factors that means that you've moved away from being rigorous
   0.50 -1 That is not so easy to do, it turns out
   0.18  0 I mean, having a process and a structure of the approach is real useful, but then you really need to make sure you have great people and then really people who -- in a culture that sustain   this and an approach that really is really creative and innovative
   0.00 -1 I feel a bit confused by the progression in Q4, and there may be some underlying impact
   0.00 -1 I think the FX has an impact
   0.00 -1 And then secondly, on FX
  -0.08  0 If I followed your guidance, just using the 5 main currencies that you have in your press release, using the [indiscernible] impact of currency on sales would be 2%; earnings, 3%
   0.11  0 so are there any other factors which I'm missing which dilute the effect -- positive effect of the weakening dollar or the hedging losses or anything like that
   0.50  0 Some clarification would be great
   0.00  1  Thanks Mark
   0.00  1 What I said earlier on that if you look at the second half of 2017, it should provide you a good guide for what the level of gross margin will be in 2018
  -0.50  0 It is also in our press release
   0.10  0 We deduct from gross margin the profit-sharing we provide Merck as well as we do for Circassia, so we have indicated what goes in or comes out of the gross margin
   0.00 -1 There's another factor that you need to consider that explain that, in comparison to the first half of 2017, the gross margin is lower, we have larger expenditures and depreciation in the biopharmaceutical capabilities
   0.09  0 But if I put this aside, the 2 main factors are the profit margin given to the partners -- this is one -- and the more expensive production capabilities for the biopharm product
   0.00  1 Let me just close by thanking you all for your interest and your great questions and just kind of repeating what I said a bit earlier is we are at the stage where the pipeline is delivered
   0.00  1 We have 7 products that are either in launch mode or growing very, very fast so that explains we need to resource them, but that also drives very substantial growth rate
   0.00  1 For us, it is material, very material and growing very rapidly, and it's our second-largest market globally
   0.00  1 So with that, I will, again, thank you and wish you a good weekend
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

  -0.11  0 Before we make a start, I'll just draw your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer
   0.00  1  Well, thanks, Chris, and good morning
   0.00  1 It's nice to have you back, as always
   0.20  0 Now believe it or not, this is always one of my favorite days of the year and we have a very full room this morning
  -1.00  0 For the last few years been selling and restructuring
   0.00  1 And in these results we are seeing some strong signs of growth, nearly everywhere you look
   0.00  1 Well, first, I think it's important, is broad-based growth across the key franchises, with the key notable exception of Canada
   0.00  1 But other than that the earnings growth is translated into very strong dividend growth as well
  -0.14  1 Capital generation, that remained strong at GBP 2.6 billion and we increased our solvency cover ratio to 198%
   0.00  1 Cash remittances were also up 33% to GBP 2.4 billion and we are expecting another decent year of cash remittances in 2018
   0.00  1 Now we've also increased the dividend to 27.4p per share
   0.00  1 That's, as I'm sure you've seen -- and that's an increase of 18% that delivers on our 50% payout ratio for '17 as we had promised
   0.00  1 And the next slide here shows we're getting a pretty decent track record of growing EPS and growing dividends, we need them both, although this year you can see that the rate of growth has certainly accelerated
   0.00  1 We delivered 54.8p per share in EPS in 2017, that's up 7%
   0.00  1 Quite simply, we've done better than we thought we were going to
   0.00  1 Now this is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in the dividend and I think a lot of people probably forget that
   0.00  1 And given our increased ambition on the earnings growth and our target of a 55% to 60% payout ratio by 2020, we would expect that our dividend growth will continue to be strong going forward
  -0.08  0 Now   I guess while we're also on the dividend, it's important to also, I guess, reflect on the fact that we are back above the 26p per share, which of course was the level, which was a cut back in the dark days of 2013
   0.00  1 So therefore, the dividend is sustainable and growing
   0.09  0 But I guess, of course, you would expect that [indiscernible] the balance sheet and the franchises and the quality of the earnings is frankly in a fundamentally different position
  -0.14  1 And this is probably the most we've seen, it's a diversity of growth across many of our businesses
   0.20  0 There are plenty of green on the slide and I think this is a key slide
   0.00  1 Now this is a strong set of numbers
   0.00 -1 Canada had a terrible year, there is no hiding from that
   0.00 -1 Profits declined by over GBP 220 million year-on-year
  -0.13  1 But Canada, importantly, does highlight a key part of our overall investment thesis and that is one of the strengths that comes with our diversity, now diversity both geographically and in our product as a composite, is that we can overcome setbacks like Canada and still deliver and meet our targets and deliver some pretty good set of results
   0.00  1 In 6 out of 8 of our core markets, of our major 8 markets, delivered double-digit growth in earnings as you can see on the slide
   0.00  1 Now we had a strong year from our U.K
   0.00  1 business
   0.00  1 That's a pretty good example
   0.00  1 product lines, specifically helped by the composite and digital strategies
   0.00  1 still increased 7%
   0.00  1 So whether you call out 13% or 7% from the U.K., it's still a good performance from Andy and the team and that demonstrates that the U.K
   0.00  1 There -- we think -- there are number of reasons, as I said, but this has partly been a flight to quality and the flight to the big brands and we've clearly been a beneficiary of that
   0.00  1 There was good news from our other markets as well, though
   0.00  1 France, Poland, Ireland, and Singapore were all comfortably in double-digit territory
   0.00 -1 They were a victim in some ways of their own success
   0.00  1 Quite simply, our remaining franchises are competing, they're growing sales, they're growing market share and more importantly, they're growing profits and cash
   0.00  1 For example, in the U.K., long-term savings net inflows were up 2x
   0.00  1 We increased our BPA volumes more than 3x
   0.00  1 That's a pretty nice milestone
   0.00  1 In Europe, we doubled VNB in Italy
   0.00  1 We also grew in France and Poland
  -0.08  1 And in Singapore, the disrupted financial advisor model, which is certainly disrupting the market, that helped grow VNB 29% and contributed meaningfully to the profit
   0.00  1 So we are aiming higher in terms of our EPS growth
   0.00  1 And our growth drivers across these businesses, they're not rocket science
   0.33  0 It's the same thing that it [ wound up winning us ] business, so -- winning us business in the last 12 months
   0.00  1 And we expect to see continued growth in areas like Aviva Investors, long-term savings and GI businesses across Europe
   0.00  1 France, it's gaining momentum for us
   0.00  1 Now on top of the baseline from our major markets, there is also the prospect of higher long-term growth from our strategic investments that we have on this slide
  -0.12  0 I was in Asia a few weeks ago and a Chinese investor noted to me an interesting fact that I'd sort of overlooked
  -0.12  0 So the potential was clearly there, but I look at that as potential for disruption and potential for long-term growth
   0.08 -1 But despite the track record and the recent track record and despite the EPS growth, one of the questions we are often asked is still [ growth ] in the long term
  -0.33  0 And I think that's fair enough as a question
   0.00  1 You see, I believe the insurance world has fundamentally changed and reached an inflection point
   0.00  1 We are seeing growth, we're seeing growth across the board
   0.00  1 And in fact, we are also seeing that margins in our more developed markets are very robust, simply because the more irrational players have exited, there's fewer competitors
   0.00  1 Now in each of our markets, there are also structural drivers of growth
   0.00  1 And some of it is margin with increased scale through our initiatives and also consolidation in the market
   0.00  1 We have relationships and industry experience, allow us to selectively expand in this market
   0.00  1 Now we have a number of structural and deliberate competitive advantages to grow, which you can also see in the slide
  -0.25  1 Brand is critically important, particularly in digital
   0.00  1 And our investments in data analytics and artificial intelligence, I believe, is industry leading
   0.00  1 We now have 550 -- 550 data scientists and that's this capability that won us a number of large insurance mandates in the last year
  -0.17  0 Now at our Investor Day in November, we outlined our intention to deploy GBP 2 billion in '18 and a further GBP 1 billion in 2019
   0.00  1 Now as you've heard in the previous slides, our first priority is organic growth
  -0.25  0 First on M&A and quite a topical subject in the insurance world right now
  -0.25  0 Now M&A by its nature is opportunistic, and we won't chase deals just because we have the cash
  -0.17  0 To be very clear, though, it is our intention to return at least GBP 500 million of capital to shareholders this year
  -0.14  0 You should note that we have the ability to cancel these prefs at par with shareholder approval
   0.14 -1 We are all very aware that a track record for consistency and dependability is only ever built over time
   0.00  1 But we are now heading to I think that track record each year
   0.00  1 Each year our EPS has grown
   0.00  1 But this year the growth has accelerated and is much more broad-based
   0.00  1 It's another year where we have strength in capital and cash and we now have the very high quality problem of deploying it productively
   0.00  1 It's another year where we have increased our dividend double digits and that's on the back of earnings and increase in the earnings, both in quantum, but also into their translation into cash, which to me is equally as important
   0.00  1  Thank you and good morning
   0.00  1 Our operating EPS was up 7%
   0.00  1 As the slide shows, our 8 major markets delivered 6% operating profit growth in 2017, up over GBP 200 million year-on-year and would have delivered even more if it had not been from the setback in Canada
   0.09  0 It is Aviva's biggest and most fully developed business, and in many ways serves as a model for what we want to achieve across our group
   0.00  1 We did something similar in France about 14 months ago, moving Patrick Dixneuf to leave that business with good results, as you can see here
   0.00  1 So we have the right team on the field now, with proven operators in all 8 of our major markets and an acute focus on delivering results
  -0.10  0 We're addressing the impact of those divestitures partly through capital management, so it's not worth dwelling on here
  -0.25  0 But the first usual stop on NAV
   0.00  1 Book value per share is up 2%, as dividends, the share buyback, AVIF amortization and restructuring costs offset operating profit
  -0.20  0 Integration and restructuring costs declined by 1/3 and should be approximately 0 for 2018
   0.00 -1 AVIF will also be lower in the future once we complete the sale of FPI
   0.00  1 So we should have improving prospects for NAV growth, subject to the likelihood of additional return of capital to shareholders in 2018 and 2019
   0.00  1 Basic earnings per share more than doubled to 35p
   0.00  1 Long-term savings net flows nearly doubled to GBP 5.6 billion
   0.00  1 Bulk annuity sales tripled to GBP 2 billion and protection VNB was up 21%
   0.00  1 Now this includes profits from our legacy book, which stayed strong at GBP 331 million, although as previously guided, it will decline gradually over time
  -0.33  0 So let me stop and explain this
   0.00  1 Much, but not all of this, is related to our annuity business, which has over GBP 50 billion of reserves and is growing
   0.10  0 Please note that while we're not counting on future reserve releases, we will manage our pace of spending on other improvements and investments in the business, with an eye on the net impact of this other line on our overall results
   0.09  0 Speaking of underlying growth, let's get back to our 4 core segments, where we're picking our spots and winning more business
   0.00  1 This is a big business with assets under administration up 13% to GBP 118 billion, of which platform assets increased 56% to GBP 20 billion
   0.11 -1 Last year, our annuity margins were unusually high as volumes were lower and we were allocating attractive investment assets across that lower volume
   0.00  1 We remain disciplined on margins and capital usage
   0.00  1 This is a good area for us to create value from our ability to originate private debt, which we do so as part of a balanced portfolio of business
   0.00 -1 In protection, volumes were up, but operating profit was down 6%, as we've experienced some large losses on existing business
   0.12 -1 This may weigh on profit in 2018 until rate increases work through the group protection book
   0.00  1 Weather remained benign and we had a bit less favorable prior-year development, resulting in a combined ratio of 93.9%, identical to last year
   0.00  1 Net written premiums were up 15%
   0.00  1 This is a business centered in the U.K., but serving our insurance operations and other investors all over the world and building its reputation under Euan Munro, based on outcome-oriented solutions
   0.00  1 It's more and more becoming a partner of choice for institutions and distributors and it has enough scale to operate on a very low-cost basis
   0.00  1 The operating margin increased from 27% to 29% with   revenue growth once again outpacing increases in expenses
   0.00  1 Revenue from external clients increased to 34% of the total, up from 32%
   0.00  1 The AIMS range of funds grew 40% with AUM now up to GBP 12.6 billion
   0.00  1 So a good year from Aviva Investors, but we remain thirsty for more growth here
   0.12 -1 Ideally, 10% or more, which means that Euan, David Cummings and the team have to keep working hard to outpace the rest of Aviva
   0.00  1 Over the 7 years through 2016, reserves developed favorably by 3.8 points per year on average, primarily driven by Ontario auto reforms in 2010 and 2012
   0.08  0 It probably didn't help that we were integrating the RBC General acquisition at the same time, but that's an explanation, not an excuse
   0.33  0 I'd rather have the underwriting profits any day
  -0.25  0 We're changing some claims management practices and we may exit some unprofitable distribution partners
  -0.14  0 Finally, we'll take another look at expenses and cut in some places, while reallocating in others
   0.00  1 So looking forward, this should mean a bounce back in 2018
   0.00  1 So this will be a 2018 and 2019 recovery story, with us looking to restore the business to a 94% to 96% combined operating ratio by 2020
   0.00  1 So in 2017, we maintained a favorable sales mix, consisting of 85% protection and unit-linked business, although sales volumes in VNB did not hit our growth targets
   0.00  1 For example, we're experiencing very good sales of our capital-light hybrid product through Fineco and others with volume up 76%
   0.00  1 This has driven very strong net inflows of GBP 2.3 billion, which are up 38%
   0.00  1 Value of new business more than doubled to GBP 179 million
   0.00  1 And we expect life profits to follow as we overcome the first year strain of these higher sales levels
   0.00  1 As a result, value of new business has grown 29% to GBP 123 million, with double-digit increases in savings and protection products
   0.17  0 We consider Singapore to be an important hub for us and one of the leading wealth centers in Asia
  -0.33  1 We remain very well capitalized with a Solvency II cover ratio of 198%, well in excess of our working range of 150% to 180%
   0.12  0 This is more than we had initially expected and will enable us to remit more cash up to the group center in the form of special remittances in 2018
   0.00  1 As we'll come onto in a couple slides, we've clearly have more room to do more of that in 2018
  -0.06  1 Our Solvency II cover ratio may trend still higher, although our capital management decision should moderate that trend as we redeploy our return on capital that we don't need in the business
   0.00  1 We've secured use of a dynamic volatility adjuster or DVA for use in France, which is a positive for dividend capacity over time
  -0.18  1 Central liquidity also remained strong at GBP 2 billion and we expect more cash, more divestitures of Spain and FPI as well as future remittances from our ongoing operations
   0.00  1 So not surprisingly, we're in a   good position to fund future growth as well as address our capital management objectives throughout 2018
   0.05  0 Our capital management priorities remain consistent with what we've stated before, with a preference for organic growth and a progressive dividend, followed by a combination of repaying expensive debt, bolt-on M&A and additional capital returns
  -0.12  0 As Mark said, one of the things we're looking at is the possibility of a liability management exercise concerning one or more tranches of preferred securities issued by either our General Accident subsidiary, or Aviva plc
  -0.11  0 The rating agencies don't count them as capital anymore and they likely will not count for capital for Solvency II purposes from 2026
  -0.12  0 So while we've not taken any decisions, we note that these securities are subject to cancellation at par upon a capital reduction approved by ordinary and preferred shareholders voting as a single class
   0.00  1 As we complete our divestiture program, this is now less about which countries we favor, as we see opportunities across all of our major markets, and it's more about capabilities
  -0.05  1 We are investing for the future by building data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities, adding to our distribution capabilities and expanding in Aviva Investors, bulk purchase annuities and Global Corporate and Specialty insurance
   0.50  0 We obviously still have plenty to do
   0.09  0 To do so, I'll start with the bridge showing how our operating EPS progressed from 2016 to 2017 and use that as a basis for helping you think about how 2018 may turn out
   0.00 -1 As you can see, the balance sheet was actually a negative contributor to growth with the incremental positives in U.K
   0.00 -1 Life more than offset by the less favorable reserve development in Canada and U.K
   0.00  1 Our businesses will perform as they will, but Mark and I are asking each of the major markets to hit an earnings growth target, which is higher than 5%, and in some cases considerably higher
  -0.08  0 Now also keep in mind that last year's buyback and debt deleveraging happened late in the year, so only had a partial impact on 2017 with more to follow in 2018
   0.10 -1 This is helpful because we've had a series of   business unit sales, which affected us in 2017 and will affect us again in 2018 as sales complete in the middle of the year with some residual effect in 2019
   0.25  0 Now tax helped us in 2017, but our effective operating tax rate is likely to be a little higher in 2018, depending on the business mix of our profits
   0.08  0 Taken all together, you can simplify this and just say that our EPS growth in 2018 really depends on how much organic growth we get from our major markets
  -0.08  1 And since we have a lot of conviction around those businesses, we're bringing forward management's target for operating EPS growth to exceed 5%
   0.00  1 I'll remind you, in addition to growing EPS, we also expect to increase the dividend payout ratio to our new target payout ratio of 55% to 60% by 2020
   0.00  1 Cash dividends have increased 83% during my tenure over the last 4 years and we want to keep them growing sustainably for years to come
  -0.25  0 Well, I think we should just get straight into questions actually
  -0.25  0 And I have got all the operating heads up here too, so we can probably pass the questions around a little
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -1.00  0 This is question one
  -0.14  0 When we have the case study, we [ obviously ] ended up paying GBP 0.5 billion when things went wrong
  -0.07  0 I just wonder if you could update, then tell us if there's going to be some fallout in terms of net current cash flow costs from [indiscernible]?  [indiscernible] to capital, and Andy if you can talk about that one
   0.09  0 So I'm assuming by talking about management actions, you're effectively talking about the other line in U.K
   0.00  1 Life where we were up about GBP 139 million year-over-year
   0.10 -1 Again, one of the things that I tried to say was that as we look at our experience and longevity, effectively we're at the conservative end of the spectrum and as it appears that trends are showing less improvement in longevity over time, that's causing us to need to release reserves there
  -0.12  0 Your second question was around the amount of margin in our IFRS -- IFRS reserves on the GI side
  -0.14  0 We don't disclose exactly what that number is, but I would tell you the way we look at it is at a specific point
   0.00  1 We saw our long-term saving net fund flows double to GBP 5.6 billion
   0.00  1 Total assets there up to GBP 118 billion
   0.11  0 Because of the success and our commitment to that market, we decided we needed to upgrade to more modern technology that would be scalable
   0.00 -1 And we are at the very conservative end of that, which is a far bigger issue
  -0.33  0 I've got three questions
   0.00  1 Slide #6 looks pretty interesting, I mean you're flagging that 6 markets out of your 8 has delivered double-digit growth
   0.09  0 I mean you're guiding for 94%-96% by 2020, but will it be back-end loaded, front-end loaded, any thoughts on that would be great?  Okay
   0.00  1 It's one of the benefits of our diversity, rather you can pull various levers, frankly
   0.20  0 But we would expect greater than 5%, we're not going to give any more guidance
   0.00  1 is pretty strong for us at the moment, pretty much across the board
   0.00  1 France is very much -- France has got some -- just a new impetus, a new momentum and a clearer strategy and you're seeing that happen
   0.00  1 we are unique in being a composite player across all the major markets
   0.00  1 So that strategy is working really well for us
  -0.14  0 The back-book, we just had a number of larger claims, just as you get in insurance businesses from time to time
  -0.12  1 And then we have seen that the claims experience in some parts of our income protection book has been higher than we were assuming
   0.00  1 And so we can absorb that impact on existing business in protection and still deliver strong growth
  -0.33  0 Let me respond to your Canadian question
  -0.30  0 What happens then is the actors in the system, namely the claims farmers and the plaintiff bar look to rehash, recycle their files
   0.00  1 We saw an incredible increase in injury costs
  -0.33  0 That's how we manage the claims
   0.00  1 So when you are having an increased flow on older files, the 2 things that you have to do, and actually things that Aviva is very good at and we've demonstrated that both here in the U.K
  -0.25  0 and Ireland, and historically also in Canada, it's managing defensible programs and it's also managing fraud
  -0.18  0 Look at your mix of business, right, you look at your selection of business, you look at your filters and you look at your deviations and you tighten those up
   0.00  1 I expect the rate to accelerate, particularly in the regular lines
   0.00  1 So I would expect this to start benefiting us more in the latter half of '18 and into '19, as opposed to right now
  -0.50  0  I have a couple of questions, if I could
   0.00  1 I think you said you are well ahead of the plan on the underlying cash generation, you are showing GBP 750 million out of a GBP 1 billion-plus remittances from Friends Life
  -0.20  0 And I can see, in France, you got the DVA locally, which pieces the solvency in France
  -0.17  0 And the third question is in terms of the liability management, obviously, you said sometime before 2020
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 We're going to be ahead of that
   0.00  1 So again, that is one of the things that will help us get to our cash remittance target
   0.00  1 And we then got it recognized in France, which does help, gives you a fair bit more headroom to help dividends coming out from France
  -0.07  0 The instant thing you would have seen, though -- well, some of you may have picked up, was [indiscernible] put out a report on DVA, specifically saying that it was part of Solvency II and needed to be implemented
   0.00 -1 I would expect that to cause a rethink in the PRA
   0.00  1 And in France, it is certainly helpful for securing dividends
  -0.12  0 Does that actually make sense?  And then on your question on liability management
  -0.50  0 That's a good question
  -0.11  0 We think it's an interesting question because the -- these are very expensive securities that don't count for capital for us anymore
  -0.17  0 At the same time, we want to be very deliberate and careful in terms of how we approach them
   0.12  0 So all that's very actively under consideration and I'd expect us to be able to come to conclusions relatively soon
   0.00 -1 Obviously, you've guided to kind of lower levels of remittances going forward
   0.25  0 So I was wondering if you could give us an update there, please
   0.11  0 The second was just on the [ NI ] optimization progress you've made on the U.K
   0.09  0 annuity book and how much of the book has been shifted into liquid assets versus the numbers you've talked to previously, if you could give us some information there, please
  -0.14  0 Obviously, the GBP 4 billion of infrastructure that you referenced is a quite sizable figure
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 I can't give you specifics in terms of timing because we've got to work through the regulatory environment in the way that works, but that still is a possibility for us, which would improve our overall liquidity
   0.00 -1 I mean, again, this is a temporary phenomenon in Canada
  -0.10  0 They should come back and we've got enough cash and liquidity right now, but it doesn't really change any of our capital planning
  -0.33  0  Euan on the liquid
   0.06  0 One big part of the investment in Aviva Investors is in that liquid origination theme because it's also an ideal asset class for defined benefit pension plans
  -0.25  0  just a further addition on the liquidity point before
  -0.06  1 In fact, as we've realized, we've actually built up quite a buffer in a number of subsidiaries in terms of capital and cash and over the next period of time, we'll look to bring a bit more of that up that
   0.00 -1 So it's just not really a key issue for us
  -0.14  0 Three questions, first a follow-up on the re-risking of the annuity assets
   0.00 -1   And I know you say the tables are less important, it's all about the calibration, but -- and you were more conservative there
   0.00  1 Thanks
  -0.06  0  On the asset yield on the annuity business, I don't think we actually disclose that, I don't know if you want to comment any further, but I don't think we provide that detail
   0.20  0 We were at 69 basis points IFRS profit margin last year
   0.00  1 I mean, if we've got GBP 25 billion of GBP 57 billion in our liquids, and we're happy to have over half, I think you can kind of do the math yourself
   0.25  0 And last year, we did GBP 650 million, got GBP 86 million of profit from it
   0.00  1 I mean, the other observation I'd make is that we've got here one of the key structural growth drivers in the U.K
   0.00  1 market is the structural growth from the DB to DC shift, the aging population and auto-enrollment
   0.14  0 So effectively, we've got to take that evidence and act on it
   0.00  1 And again that may be another one of the reasons why you see this continue to develop favorably in the future
   0.12  0 We're always trying to use the latest information that we have time to rolling that and [ perimeterize ] properly
   0.00 -1 So all through that, yes, there are releases, but there is also a bit of prudence
  -0.08  0 And as I said in my remarks, unless trends reverse, if we continue to see confirmation of these trends, it means we're going to have more excess prudence that we're going to have to go ahead and release
   0.00  1 But sort of the quick read suggests that it's confirming the trends that we've been seeing
  -0.50  0 It's not that complicated
   0.00 -1 You mentioned issues in motor
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
   0.07  0 The hybrid product -- I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about whether that's unusual, given you had very high volume or in a normal year, is the strength of that product is such, you should be able to grow the earnings and the volume?  Do you want to take the Italy one first and then we will hand over to [ Maurice ]
   0.20  0 So on the hybrid strength, there's nothing unusual about this
   0.00 -1 So we may see more strain in the future, if we continue to have high levels of growth
   0.07  0 So there may be similar strain issues in the future, but we're sort of being long-term greedy here in terms of looking at the overall amount of profit that we can generate from this business
   0.00  1 So the hybrid product which you alluded to, so first -- and the composition of that is actually 30% with product, with a par guarantee and 70% you know, like -- and if you look at what's happened in Italy on the back of recovery, you've got a huge savings propensity
   0.00  1 So we currently have some of the best flows, savings flows in Europe or in Italy
   0.00  1 And those flows were accelerating
   0.00  1 So I think we're feeling pretty good about [ Italy ] also moving forward
  -0.50  0 So again, really three questions
  -0.08  0 Clearly, we need to take more rates in the 2 regulated lines because you have a lag between the time you file and the time it gets approved
  -0.14  0 But we're also looking at our property lines and taking excess rate
   0.00  1 We have a very strong property book, so we're taking rate there
   0.00  1 If we get regulatory reform, certainly that actually probably accelerates recoveries
  -0.22  0 And effectively without going through the 300 pages of that Marshall report, the finding was that if you look at the claim spend, 50% of the claim spend does not go to the injured person
  -0.09  0 What they've actually recommended in the Marshall report is to put caps and limits on different types of disabilities
  -0.07  0 It's no different than taking the Whiplash abuse and saying, you know what, we're going to go [ carrying ] on cash and get rid of sort of all of these sort of practitioners
  -0.50  0 Two final questions, Angel and then across to Andy Sinclair
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.25  0 But that's been relatively stable overall
   0.25  0 So I'd like to see that progressing north of GBP 2 billion over the next few years
  -0.20  0 Lastly, let me come to the tax implications
   0.12  0 And then if you think about our mix of business, what really drives our tax rate is where we get the profit from
   0.00  1 So that's why we've guided to something a little bit higher than where we were for this year
   0.20  0  And look, on the M&A, the answer to that, it would depend
   0.50  0 So I mean put all that together, it all depends
  -0.50  0 But we will be a bit opportunistic
   0.00  1 And I think we got a pretty decent track record of doing this as well
   1.00  0 Three for me, please
   0.05  0 Firstly on workplace pensions, you're probably number one competitor has effectively walked away and said, it's not really possible to make money in the administration of workplace pensions just without getting the asset management mandates as well
   0.11  0 And thirdly, just wondered if you could give us an update on AIMS flows and request for information
   0.00  1 I mean [Audio Gap] I think the composite strategy comes in here, though, because what we find is, is we're growing ahead of the market, basically through the composite strategy
   0.07  0 I mean, if I give you a good example of that would be Pearson Group, where when we actually started off with our corporate pension scheme, we went from there to win their healthcare, and then won the GBP 600 million bulk annuity from them
   0.12  0 Morrison Supermarkets we started off with their healthcare and moved from there to win their workplace pension scheme
   0.00  1 So we are finding that in the large corporate market, the composite strategy is really working well for us and it's why we're growing ahead of our competitors
   0.00  1 It really is having a big impact across all our businesses in   [Audio Gap] bringing our administration costs lower and hence margins higher
   0.00  1 We think it's expanded our capabilities since [Audio Gap] good deal for us over the long run
   0.00  1 One of the things I would say that is not understood is that if you want a simple balanced fund or a multi-asset fund, or a diversified growth fund, we do them, the multi-asset funds and Aviva Investors were up 8% last year
   0.00  1 So do compare our multi-asset funds with other fund managers balanced funds and you'll find we're actually pretty good at that as well
   0.00  1  Thank you, everyone
   0.00  1 We're in a pretty good place at the moment
   0.00  1 So you can see broad-based growth
  -0.14  0 I mean the question that we've been asked a lot over the last couple of years is where is the growth coming from
   0.00 -1 Probably, yeah, there was -- for me, there was really only 2 surprises
   0.00  1 Frankly, the consumer side, even though we passed the GBP 1 billion mark, the consumer side took longer than we thought to get the propositions out, but that's now going pretty well
   0.00  1 That's where we've seen the traction perhaps a bit earlier than we thought
   0.00  1 composite digital model is a pretty good blueprint to some of the other markets as well, where we are getting the traction
   0.00  1 But we'll do our best
   0.00  1 And thanks for joining us

---FILE: BAE Systems plc.txt

   0.00  1 There's absolutely no doubt that 2017 was a successful year
   0.00 -1 As we enter 2018, a substantial order book will, however, not shield the company from a year when the rhythm of customer delivery schedules make our ambitions for sales and profit performance a little more challenging than usual
  -0.05  1 It has been made clear to me by customers, shareholders and employees that all have valued the preservation of seasoned executive experience with the introduction of fresh thinking and renewed energy in the management team at this time of geopolitical turbulence
   0.00  1 Now this has also been true in the nonexecutive area with the appointment of Revathi Advaithi to our boardroom, a woman with strong international -- very strong international pedigree, relevant engineering and digital skills, first-class credentials and really good senior operational experience at both Honeywell and Eden Corporation
  -0.11  1 So, so far, so good, but the defense market is becoming more competitive, and customers continue to be demanding, both at home and abroad
   0.20  0 And in this context, it is pleasing that a very close [ liaison ] in the U.K
   0.12  0 Now this will be particularly important in 2018 in the pursuit of major business opportunities in land, sea and air that are currently under negotiations
   0.00  1 Overall, operational performance was strong
   0.00  1 Order intake of just over GBP 20 billion meant our large order backlog was sustained, and that's before booking the Qatar order, ensuring good visibility of future sales
  -0.17  0 As usual, we'll take your questions at the end of the presentation
  -0.10  1 Our highly skilled workforce is delivering some of the world's most challenging and complex engineering programs
   0.00  1 In 2017, we saw a higher tempo of activity across many of our businesses
   0.00  1 business continued its ramp to rate in combat vehicles and a number of Electronic Systems products
   0.00  1 maritime programs, continue the production ramp in Electronic Systems in U.S
   0.00 -1 Secondly, competitiveness
  -0.11  0 In 2017, we commenced restructuring actions in military air, maritime services and Applied Intelligence
   0.00  1 These difficult but necessary actions will maintain critical capabilities and enhance our competitive position in securing anticipated new orders
   0.00  1 Additionally, the streamlined organizational structure, in place since January 1, has been designed to drive focus and performance in each of the 3 key priority areas
   0.07  0 For 2018, we need to drive efficiencies across a number of supply chain categories and implement a more strategic approach to managing our suppliers and our design, engineering and manufacturing processes
   0.00  1 Technology is a key driver of competitive advantage and, increasingly, a critical determinant for our customers in awarding new business
   0.08  0 In 2017, we increased self-funded R&D by 15%, expanded our partnerships with academia and appointed Nigel Whitehead into the position of Chief Technology Officer
   0.00  1 We have a firm foundation, and whilst there is much to do, we are well-placed
  -0.25  0 contracted programs in submarine and shipbuilding
  -0.08  0 These are critical programs for the U.K., and this sector now reports directly to me, with an absolute focus on program execution
  -0.20  1 Defense budget by approximately 10% over current levels
  -0.04  1 Our U.S.-based businesses continue to plan conservatively and remain well-aligned with customer priorities and growth areas, and we see continued support for increases in defense spending, as demonstrated by the President's recently released 2019 budget request
  -0.14  0 In the U.K., defense and security remains a priority for the government
  -0.12  1 We continue to execute on these while working with our customers to address their affordability challenges
   0.00  1 Whilst Pete will outline 2018 guidance in a few minutes, given the market conditions I've just outlined, I wanted to give you more color on the strength and medium-term outlook for our key franchises and contracted programs
   0.00  1 Electronic Systems has a very broad, well-placed technology driven portfolio
   0.00  1 Growth will be generated across the portfolio from F-35 ramp-up and F-15 upgrade programs, as well as from increased activity in the classified domain
   0.00  1 Our APKWS product is also seeing significant demands
   0.00  1 Platforms & Services is set to deliver growth from all 3 of its businesses
   0.00  1 shipyards, we are well-placed to compete for future work
   0.00  1 Indian M777 production is ramping up, and there's a good drumbeat of work through our Holston and Radford munition facilities
   0.00 -1 The main points to note: As previously flagged, Typhoon and Hawk production will reduce in 2018
   0.09  0 Typhoon is then expected to stabilize based on the current order book and anticipated finalization of the Qatar order
   0.00  1 Typhoon support, already generating more revenue than production, is expected to grow as further aircraft are delivered into service
   0.11  0 and Australia, we continue to work on long-term support positions with our industrial partners and customers
   0.00  1 The final point I would draw out is that our MBDA joint venture has again grown its order book to stand at nearly EUR 17 billion
   0.00  1 This supports good sales growth in the medium term
   0.08  0 The maritime sector is underpinned by our long-term positions on Astute and Dreadnought and on the Type 26 frigate program
   0.00  1 maritime budgets are under pressure, this contracted programs give us stability and visibility
   0.00  1 Intelligence & Security business is well-run with a high tempo of bid activity
  -0.17  0 The business is a mix of shorter cycle contracts in what is a highly competitive market
   0.04 -1 Reflecting the poor operational performance and goodwill impairment, our U.K.-based Applied Intelligence business has been reorganized to focus on a targeted portfolio of products, services and markets that will accelerate improvements in about competitiveness and profitability while still targeting top line growth
   0.00  1 The balance sheet remains strong, following the pension funding agreement, which derisked future cash flows
   0.00  1 And our capital allocation remains clear, consistent and disciplined
   0.00  1 The business is well- placed from his contracted programs and long-standing franchise positions to deliver growth in the medium term
   0.00  1  Good morning, everybody
   0.00  1   And firstly, in terms of 2017, underlying earnings per share was up 8%, and that's towards the higher end of our guidance range
  -0.11  1 And the EMEA loss, as Charles referred to, at Applied Intelligence was matched by good performance across the rest of the group
  -0.09  1 Our strong order backlog was maintained on a like-for-like basis, and that's without yet having booked the Qatar Typhoon contract
   0.00  1 The dividend was growing for the 14th consecutive year with earnings cover sustained
   0.00 -1 And at the earnings level, the headwind from U.S
   0.00  1 services businesses, growth is projected to be strong
   0.00  1 And finally, in terms of free cash flow generation, we see around GBP 2 billion being delivered across 2017 in aggregate, and that's ahead of consensus
  -0.25  0 There's been some volatility in exchange rates in the year
   0.00  1 Sales increased by GBP 0.6 billion to GBP 19.6 billion, and the majority of that has been due to currency translation
   0.00  1 Underlying earnings before interest tax and amortization increased by GBP 129 million to GBP 2,034,000,000
   0.00  1 Underlying finance costs in the year decreased marginally to GBP 245 million, underlying earnings per share were at 43.5p, and that's up 8% over 2016
   0.00  1 And net debt at the end of the year closed ahead of our guidance at GBP 0.8 billion
   0.00  1 And as I mentioned, the dividend for the year has been increased to 21.8p per share
  -0.06  0 We have taken an impairment charge of GBP 384 million against the goodwill carrying value on the Applied Intelligence business, prudently reflecting the future level and timing of expected returns from that business
   0.08  0 Firstly, as anticipated, the remainder of the advances received in 2012 on the Omani Typhoon and Hawk order as well as European Typhoon production are almost all now consumed
  -0.29  1 And that lower pension deficit also drives the reduced deferred tax assets
  -0.09  0 corporation tax has had no impact on the 2017 underlying earnings, it has also reduced the deferred tax asset by GBP 67 million
   0.09  0 So I'm now going to move on to the pension deficit position and the clarity achieved through last November's funding agreement
  -0.25  0 So firstly, a look at the accounting deficit
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.07  0 There are a number of moving parts here, which I'll touch on, but the combined impact of them all is a GBP 2.2 billion increase -- sorry, decrease in the group share of the pretax deficit
  -0.17  0 So overall, a net GBP 2.2 billion reduction in the accounting deficit
   0.50  0 funding position
  -0.25  0 This is a complicated chart, so let me step you through it
  -0.20  0 To the left of the chart, in the first column, is the accounting deficit
  -0.50  0 funding deficit
   0.10  0 So in terms of the 2 columns in the middle, column 2 adds back the benefit of the latest actuarial mortality tables
   0.12  0 This slide sets out the movement from our net debt position of GBP 1,542,000,000 at the beginning of the year
   0.00  1 The operating business cash flow of GBP 1,752,000,000 was clearly ahead of guidance
  -0.12  0 But just to note, the total cash outflow for pension deficit funding made in 2017 was GBP 271 million
   0.00  1 Sales compared to 2016 were up 5% at $4,685,000,000
   0.00  1 The growth came in the electronic warfare business from the F-35 and DEWS programs as well as an increasing volume of classified activity
   0.00  1 Sales on -- of the APKWS product almost doubled over the year and now represent one of the top 5 sales lines in this sector
  -0.14  0 As expected, cash conversion of EBITDA for the full year was at 85%, excluding pension deficit funding
   0.00  1 Order backlog was at a record high of $7.3 billion, following further awards for F-35 systems, classified EW activity and APKWS product
   0.00 -1 In aggregate and slightly below guidance, sales were marginally lower at $2,346,000,000
   0.00 -1 business saw a 4% decrease, largely in a highly competitive area of IT support services to the Intel community
  -0.25  0 And that includes a GBP 24 million restructuring charge
  -0.12  1 The first half loss of GBP 27 million was reduced to a second half operating loss of GBP 10 million as the cost reduction actions under that restructuring program start to deliver bottom line benefit
   0.00 -1 Sales in the year were slightly behind guidance, down by 3% to $3.8 billion, as deliveries of land vehicles to Brazil and Japan slipped into the first half of 2018
  -0.08  0 Charges taken in the year on a commercial shipbuilding programs amounted to $16 million or 40 basis points, with just one contract now remaining for completion
   0.00  1 Order backlog was increased to $6.3 billion, supportive of future growth expectations
   0.00 -1 Platforms & Services sector, the year sales of GBP 7.7 billion were only marginally lower than 2016, slightly ahead of our guidance
   0.00  1 Activity levels on the submarine programs were ahead of plan
   0.17  0 However, that does include the temporary GBP 106 million benefit relating to VAT
   0.00 -1 As expected, order backlog reduced to GBP 16.8 billion, the GBP 5   billion order received from Qatar in December for 24 Typhoon aircraft in support has not yet been taken into the backlog pending completion of the financing package, which we expect in the coming months
   0.00  1 Sales in the international sector of GBP 4.1 billion were 5% up over 2016
   0.00  1 With all 72 Salam Typhoon aircraft now in service, we have seen high levels of support
   0.00  1 And in addition, we've seen expected ramp-up coming from MBDA's strong order backlog
   0.10  0 Operating cash flow was at GBP 671 million, although GBP 300 million of that was for the advance payment on the Saudi support program
   0.00  1 Order backlog was marginally higher at GBP 13.3 billion as further order intake was booked under the renewal of the 5-year support contract in Saudi Arabia, and Qatar naval orders became effective within MBDA
  -0.20  0 And in addition, the numbers have been restated under the new IFRS 15 accounting standard
  -0.08  0 On the majority of our longer-term contracts, revenue is recognized earlier as we incur costs rather than on performance milestones or deliveries
   0.08  0 But on those long-term contracts, profit will continue to be recognized progressively based on risk mitigation and retirement
  -0.17  0 On the shorter-term contracts, mainly in our U.S
   0.00 -1 So as expected, whilst reported 2017 sales under IFRS have reduced by around GBP 1 billion, the impact on our earnings per share is just 1.4p
  -0.22  0 And I'd stress now that the IFRS 15 will not change the way in which we manage our contracts nor does it change the lifetime contract profitability nor our cash flows
  -0.14  0 And we have included full reconciliations on both the new sectors and the IFRS 15 restatement in your packs
  -0.09  1 Overall, we expect 2018 sales in dollar terms to show high single-digit growth driven by a number of electronic warfare contracts
   0.00  1 And in aggregate, we expect the sales to be marginally higher in '18
   0.00  1 In the Applied Intelligence business, we expect to see some top line growth, again coming from the U.K
   0.00  1 And here, we expect sales growth to be double-digit with increasing volumes from the U.S
   0.00  1 combat vehicles and weapons system businesses, as well as higher ship repair activity
   0.09  0 Here, we expect sales to be stable as activity levels on carrier reduce but are largely offset by increases on the submarine programs
  -0.14  0 And of note, only some 5% of the sector sales come from short-term service and support contracts
   0.00  1 Underlying finance costs are expected to be around 15% lower, benefiting from the weaker dollar, in which most of the group's interest cost is borne, reduce charges within our equity-accounted investments and lower net present value charges
   0.40  0 And the final number there is, of course, dependent upon the geographic mix of profits
  -0.09  0 And so with the assumption of a dollar rate at $1.40, we expect the group's 2018 underlying earnings per share to be in line with our 2017 performance, as restated under IFRS 15
   0.08 -1 As previously indicated, we expect that our historic working capital volatility will be greatly reduced as export customer advances have now been largely utilized
   0.12  0 However, in 2018, the GBP 300 million of accelerated receipts will be utilized and a temporary VAT benefit will reverse
   0.12  0 And these flow through both advances and other working capital movements lines on this chart
  -0.10  0 The final operating cash flow item is this year's pension deficit funding, which we know will be around GBP 300 million
   0.00  1 The nonoperating cash flow items are predictable
   0.00  1 Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering our order book, driving our 3 -- and driving our 3 key strategic priorities
  -0.50  0 Pete and I will now take your questions
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions for me
   0.09  0 Basically, centered on aircraft sales campaigns and ground vehicle opportunities, particularly in export markets
   0.06  0 That is to say -- I mean, obviously, with roughly like a 2-year lead time where you could see some orders come in over the next 12 or 18 months but they don't really change the pace of production, conversely, I guess, you can see a flood of orders come in, and then you decide to take rates up in about 2 years or so
   0.17  0 So if you could just kind of sort of outline how that works, that'd be great
   0.00 -1 Ostensibly, those activities were somewhat reduced while the U.S
  -0.33  0 But that ban was recently lifted
   0.10  0 So could you talk a little about how that has changed or not changed the pace of discussions around those campaigns?  Just before -- I'll let Charles talk about opportunity on export programs
   0.00 -1 So I know we've had -- we clearly stated back in -- 6 months ago, where we sat here, that we were expecting to see a sort of GBP 800 million, GBP 900 million headwind from Typhoon
   0.00 -1 So as you get those programs in, you'll see some top line coming through, albeit it will be at a very, very low margin because we're still holding on to the fact that we only trade profit and margin on contracts as when we retire risk
  -0.06  0 That part I understand, but my question is mainly more on the physical, industrial process of thinking about Typhoon production capacity under various order scenarios, but that was helpful
   0.00  1 And you've got to reflect the fact that the platform now with this -- since you had an upgrade so then going into the RAF, it is at its -- it's the most capable that it's ever been
   0.00  1 business
   0.20  0 We do have 2 pending opportunities in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
  -0.08  0 The congressional hold that was put on sales to Saudi Arabia by Senator Corker, if you'll recall, was just lifted recently
  -0.12  0 I would expect that we will probably have to renew discussions with the Saudis about in-country content mix and how we're going to deliver that
  -0.17  0 Jerry, hopefully you've got more extended answer than I have on the first question
   0.00  1  In both the FY '18 and FY '19 budgets that have been approved by the authorizers in Congress, we see strong growth potential in, really, 3 or 4 areas
   0.00  1 They're -- all of those will increase by about 50%
   0.00  1 You could see roughly another 50% increase from those budgets
  -0.08  0 As to when that would flow into revenues and earnings, you're probably -- 18 months after a contract order, you'll really see something noticeable, if that makes sense
   0.00  1 You've been very clear as to why cash conversion was strong in '18 and why it will soften a bit in -- sorry, strong in '17 and soften a bit in '18 as some of those things reverse
   0.11  0 Or is it higher, please?  I mean, the piece you're missing is what we said in the guidance this time last year, when we said that '17, we would see the end of the utilization of advance payments on those European and Saudi and Omani Typhoon production programs
   0.00 -1 Again, Typhoon production was a big step-down
   0.00 -1 And as we go into '18, we've got another step-down from that GBP 1.3 billion Typhoon production, down to that GBP 500 million that I talked about earlier on
   0.00 -1 So that's where you're getting the headwind from
  -0.11  0 And then if you look at the chart that Charles put out there, when we look at those long-term programs and franchises, there are not many arrows going downwards
  -0.50  0 Maybe the guy with the injury
   0.00  1 Or is it the feeling that you can go after a bit more of the shorter-cycle stuff that's coming through which maybe gives you a bit more short-term margin upside?  It's a bit of all of those
   0.00  1 I mean, Electronic Systems, if you look back over the last 3 years, we've delivered an -- 15% return on sales in each of the last 3 years
   0.00  1 They have performed well, they continue to perform well
   0.00  1  And some operational leverage of growing the top line quicker than the cost base
  -0.50  0  [indiscernible] question
  -0.25  0 So first question would be on strategic review
   0.16  0 And usually, early in the tenure provides a good opportunity to do a review of the portfolio to decide which businesses belong in the portfolio, which businesses could be managed better outside of the portfolio, potentially, and where you think you need to strengthen
   0.17  0 Things like vertical integration of your supply chain and digitization
  -0.33  0 And the second question is around the U.K
  -0.33  0 And maybe just a small, technical question for Pete
   0.00  1 And that's really one of those things you would not be surprised to see that we have a good, hard look
   0.00  1 All of that is good, makes us more affordable, more competitive
   0.00  1 And so far, we've identified, through supply chain and others, a rich seam of opportunities there that we'll continue to exploit for a number of years
  -0.14  0  And there was one other question on the margins in terms of the guidance for Air and Maritime
   0.10  0 We're not expecting -- it's not like the U.S., which it will be the growth engine and international opportunities
   1.00  0 is stable
   0.06  0 Take a view on the economy and where it is, but I think it's probably a relatively prudent set of assumptions to assume a stable outlook for the U.K
   0.00  1 Meantime, the work that we do for national security, both here and abroad, has been performing actually pretty well within that business
  -0.25  0 I think that, that transition, and I spoke about that a little bit at the half year, but I think that transition will happen as some of the cyber breaches and the challenges associated with them become more and more costly for customers and challenges become more obvious
   0.00  1 Part of the thrust of the question was that value realization from that, is that best if it's retained in BAE and it becomes profitable and cash-generative, or is the scope to spin it, perhaps float it or sell it to somebody else or whatever, who would pay for what that future represented?  I mean, our priority now is to get the business on sound footing, being able to, in a sense, wash its face with its own financials and make sure that it generates a reasonable return for the business
  -0.17  0 The first kind of follows on from Jeremy's question about the outlook for free cash
   0.12  0 And then, as we then think about cash conversion, I hear what you're saying on the pure-play advances
   0.33  0 I just wondered if there was anything else on the bridge that might boost the cash conversion
   0.00 -1 But the GBP 1.1 billion lower revs in '17, I think it is mainly in the new Air division
  -0.08  0 I think that's due more to more performance obligations than milestones met in previous years, but perhaps you could just clarify that and explain which the main contracts are that are sort of causing that
  -0.08  1 And then, finally, Charles, you mentioned good visibility on future sales, and Pete, I just wondered, when you look at 2018 having delivered the sort of GBP 41 billion order book and 2017, is it possible to give a steer on how much of this year's revs are already contracted or in the bag if you like?  I mean, the last one is in excess of 70%, so I think I mentioned that already in my presentation
  -0.50  0 Okay, first question was the bond
  -0.12  0 I mean, the CapEx we're spending at the moment, in excess of depreciation, is largely in the U.S
  -0.50  0 And that drag back occurs in a number of years
  -0.17  0 And probably, the best way to illustrate that is on the Typhoon Oman contract
  -0.33  0 So we got that contract at the end of 2012
  -0.07  0   So what's been happening through this IFRS 15 restatement, all the sales that we took on deliveries on those aircraft in 2017, all get pushed back to prior years when we were spending that -- incurring the cost and spending the cash
   0.00 -1 So pulling sales into prior years
  -0.09  0 The margin, however, which is why you see 13.3% margin, I think, it was for the sector as restated, doesn't change the margin performance on that program
   0.10  0 So you get a lot of profit coming through, when we made the deliveries, because the risk have been retired, but almost no sales, because all sales have been taken earlier
  -0.33  0 I've got 2 questions, if I may
   0.11  0 So you mentioned the word competitiveness, and you said that competitiveness comes from R&D, I guess, and efficient costs
  -1.00  0 My second question would be for Pete
   0.00  1 And when could you have a higher margin range?  I think competitiveness is more of a general comment, that there are opportunities that we can exploit at the enterprise level, be it through procurement, technology, so on and so forth, to do more and offer more a competitive product to our customers, which has to help us in export markets and here in the U.K
  -0.29  0 I mean, there's no question that defense budgets, whilst they might be growing, customers want to do more with less
   0.50  0 And we are finding some -- a number of opportunities
  -0.08  1 So these businesses, I've said already, they're well-run businesses, but there is a layer at the enterprise that we've not exploited before that we will continue to push hard
  -0.09  0  On the Air question, I think, if -- when you look at the margins between production and support, they're not that different in any of our businesses
  -0.12  0 And if you look within the Air sector, for example, now it's Saudi support business, the Saudi customer -- as you know, the Saudi contracts are government-to- government contracts
  -0.17  0 We execute those contracts on behalf of the U.K
   0.00  1 It's very consistent
   0.00 -1 It doesn't work like that
   0.14  0 Pete, just on the Eurofighter production comment, the comment that it's stable post '18
  -0.20  0 As I understand it, Oman drops to 0 in '19, U.K
   0.09  0 And even notwithstanding percentage of completion accounting, I don't   see how it's stable unless you have in your business planning a new order
  -0.25  0 So if you could comment on that, or if I just got it wrong, which I may have
   0.50  0 And the 2 for the CEO, please
   0.11  0 The U.K., I mean, you said it looks like a stable outlook, but from what I read in the newspapers, frankly, it could be anything
   0.00 -1 It strikes me there may be downside risk potentially
  -0.09  0 So I just wonder if you could talk about this flexibility in your system, in the workforce, your planning for certain eventualities that may come out of this defense review
   1.00  0 And then the second one please, Charles
  -0.15  0 Interesting times in the global defense sector, because it strikes me, we're seeing more M&A, and quite substantial M&A than we've seen for about 20 years
   0.00 -1 BAE doesn't look to have a lot of flexibility
  -0.20  0 We've talked about the cash flow in previous questions
   0.00 -1 I just wonder how you feel about the risk of BAE perhaps being a little bit left behind in this latest round of consolidation
   0.00 -1 In terms of Typhoon production, as I said, we're down at sub-GBP 500 million in terms of volume
  -0.25  0 We have a contract, as I said earlier on
  -0.20  0 We're waiting for the finance package to be agreed and then we have that contract
  -0.14  0 And because from the day you start the contract and start incurring cost, we will be recognizing revenue
   0.00  1  And [indiscernible] on record, but I mean, Qatar is 2022..
  -0.14  0 You need to get off deliveries and think about when are we actually doing activity under a contract
  -0.15  0  In terms of U.K., I mean, as you know, there's defense and security reviews split into 2, security and the defense modernization program
  -0.08  1 You are aware that, in the U.K., most of the impact -- 95% of our revenues are on these long-term programs, which does give us good visibility, mindful of the affordability challenges
   0.06  0 I think, for M&A, I think we've made clear before that we do see opportunities for bolt-ons, small technology additions to the portfolio, and those are the kind of things for the [ CK ] organization that we're going to be pursuing
  -0.50  0  Yes, 23 questions, if I may
  -0.12  0 I thought I heard the word mentioned, that they went up quite a bit in the second half, just on the balance sheet, Pete
  -0.33  0 One is we took the restructuring charge in AI
  -0.20  0  And then a slightly tedious question because I can't see anything in the cash flow
  -0.11  0  And that's so small that, that doesn't even show up?  It's lost in the roundings when you get to the 0.1s of billions, yes
   0.00 -1 That's not what I expected
   0.00  1 Real bump up in orders in the second half
  -0.06  0 And there is this -- I heard what Jerry said about 10% more, but there's this argument that the public shipyards -- this is around, not me, the public shipyards now get flocked with work, so much more work comes available to third-party yards like yourself
  -0.50  0 And the pace of contracts already this year has been pretty quick
   0.00  1 So absolutely, the order backlog is building nicely
  -0.29  0 And the second question is, you mentioned MBDA quite a number of times in your prepared remarks
   0.00  1    The margins remain double-digit, and we're not expecting any significant movement from moving to full- rate production
   0.00  1  MBDA?  And on MBDA, it is seeing significant growth
   0.00  1 It's looking to move to a EUR 4 billion over a 4- to 5-year window, and it's seeing good margin growth
   0.00  1 It's a double-digit margin business and performing very well
   0.00  1 And sales growth will grow in line with increasing backlog
   0.00  1 And you saw the orders that have booked during the year, we're very proud owners of that business
   0.00  1 So it's a nice business to own
  -1.00  0  Harry Breach, Raymond James
  -0.33  0 I promise, no questions about IFRS 15, Pete
  -0.17  0 But one, I want to pick up from one of Dave's questions and another one slightly differently
  -0.17  0 But the pick- up from Dave's question is, thinking about the U.K
  -0.09  0 And then completely differently, much more a program level, it's absolutely not lost on me, Charlie, that you have Dreadnought reporting to you directly
  -0.15  0 [indiscernible]  I think we -- I mean, it's fair to say that we got on contract with a number of big programs over the last few months, and we are not seeing any real change in contracting rhythm from the U.K
   0.00  1 We've got Astute
  -0.20  0 It will require further funding later in the year, but there's no delays
  -0.12  1 And we've seen a steady drumbeat of contracting activities, as you'd expect with them
  -0.50  0  [indiscernible] for the lag?  No
  -0.25  0 And we're still at quite early days of transition to build
  -0.12  0  And Harry, from a risk perspective, financial risk perspective, This is an ascertained cost contract
  -0.20  0 We're not running those sorts of risks, if that was behind the question
  -0.50  0 Political question
  -0.17  0 You've got a new Minister of Defense who may want to become PM
  -0.17  0 When Hammond was in defense, he put on, what was it, 0.5% real increase in the modernization budget
  -0.08  0 Can you just sort of talk through the different dynamics of whether the MoD wants to increase spending outside of modernization, and hence modernization gets pushed, how do you see that -- is that 0.5% [ invalid ] or not?  Frankly, I think it would be premature to try and speculate, and it would be speculation, given the ongoing reviews that we await with interest the outcomes of
   0.00  1 And until we hear something different, we continue to work on the prior planning assumptions, noting that I think the defense secretary has said on a number of occasions that he would like to see something that is not spending neutral, is better than that
  -0.33  0 Question on the line, you may have..
  -0.33  0  Oh, question on the line
   0.33  0 Tristan Sanson of Exane, please go ahead
  -1.00  0 Had 2 questions
  -0.07  0 The first one, I wanted to follow up on the answer you made to David about the fact that you need to sync in -- about the declaration of revenue recognition versus deliveries on some large contracts
  -0.10  0 And the second question is I wanted to know if you could give us an outlook for the evolution of self-funded R&D going forward
   0.17  0  I think it's fair to say that we never plan on winning everything
   0.17 -1 That would be a great problem to deal with, but we don't plan on winning everything
  -0.18  1 I would just stress again, and I'm starting to sound like a broken record, even if we got more revenue, that's not going to change earnings
   0.12 -1 Because we will only take risk -- we will only take profit when we retire risk on a program
   0.33  0 Sales is vanity, profit is sanity and cash is king
   0.12  0 And that just depends on where we are with programs, what part of the program that is -- are developmental items within a program
   0.20  0 And I think a fair bit of it depends on the opportunities that Nigel and the team are able to put together in the context of bolt-ons as well and bring to the board
   0.17  0 But I'm certainly in a sense committed to present these   opportunities to the board
   0.00  1 And I think, done convincingly and with the right organization behind it, we can make a good case -- a good investment case to increase self-funded R&D
   0.00  1 Thank you very much
   0.00  1  Thank you very much

---FILE: Barclays plc.txt

   0.00  1 And this all realized savings of over GBP 2 billion
   0.00  1 Taken together, these accomplishments mean that we have completed our restructuring of Barclays and strategically recast the company as a diversified, transatlantic, consumer and wholesale bank
  -0.11  1 Our group PBT increased by 10% year-on-year, driven in large part by a reduction in Non-Core losses
   0.00  1 Our Consumer Cards and Payments business in Barclays International continued to produce very strong income as well as managing [ all its ] risks
   0.00  1 In the fourth quarter, our CIB performed fairly well relative to the market, with our fixed income and currency trading comparing favorably against peers in that same period
   0.14 -1 And this was despite a 20 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter from the reevaluation of U.S
  -0.20  0 deferred tax assets and a roughly 10% -- or 10 basis points charge for some litigation and conduct matters
   0.00  1 And our capacity to do so will increase over time
  -0.14  0 These are based on a CET1 ratio of around 13% and exclude litigation and conduct
  -0.10  0 We gave related guidance for group costs in 2019 of between GBP 13.6 billion to GBP 13.9 billion, also excluding litigation and conduct
   0.20  0 It is worth emphasizing in this context that Barclays today generates around 40% of our profits in the United States
   0.00  1 We will consequently benefit materially from the recent corporate tax cut in the U.S
   0.00  1 In the first demonstration of that commitment, this morning, we have announced that we plan to pay a dividend for 2018 of 6.5p, which is more than double the level we paid in 2016 and 2017, and restores the dividend to that which -- to the level that we paid to shareholders in 2015
  -0.10  0 With this in mind, we plan to supplement the ways in which we distribute excess returns beyond the annual dividend, and this will include the use of share buybacks
   0.00  1 It has been some 20 years since Barclays last used share buybacks as a means of delivering value to investors, but we expect this to be an important part of the capital return mix now going forward
   0.00  1 We are feeling increasingly confident about the capacity of this bank to generate excess capital going forward, and for our prospects of returning a greater proportion of that excess capital to shareholders through dividends and other means of distribution
   0.00  1  Thanks, Jes, and good morning to everyone
   0.07  0 In order to help you better understand the performance and trends, we've again produced a slide showing material items and other items of interest which is in the Appendix for the pack
  -0.09  0   The Q4 PBT was fairly clean with some additional litigation and conduct, principally in relation to FX matters
   0.00  1 The sell-down of BAGL to 14.9% was completed ahead of schedule
   0.00  1 Although this resulted in one-off losses of GBP 2.5 billion through the discontinued line, it has brought us significant capital benefits with around 60 basis points accretion to the CET1 ratio across the year and around 10 to come when we achieve full regulatory deconsolidation expected later this year
  -0.06  0 The Non-Core segment was closed in July, so the 2017 results include Non-Core as a segment for H1 only, with the former Non-Core reflected in the other segments in Q3 and Q4, while 2016 included a full year of losses from the Non-Core segment
  -0.17  0 The segment loss before tax was reduced by GBP 2.1 billion to GBP 0.6 billion
  -0.14  0 Excluding the Africa one-off, the DTA write-down and litigation and conduct, group RoTE was 5.6%
   0.00  1 Capital ratio accretion I referred to was also evident in Q4, with CET1 increasing from 13.1% to 13.3% despite the headwinds from the net DTA write-down and litigation and conduct charges
   0.25  0 The initial effect of U.S
   0.00  1 tax reform is negative, but it's a significant positive for us going forward
   0.10  0 And we are now guiding to a reduced group effective tax rate in 2018 and future years, expected to be in the mid-20s
   0.00  1 Q4 was another tough quarter in the markets for CIB with low volatility affecting the FICC and equity businesses, but we were pleased with our performance relative to peers
   0.00  1 We had positive jaws with a 6% reduction in group costs, excluding litigation and conduct
   0.00 -1 The impairment performance reflected a prudent risk management we've talked about many times in the past, with a 12% reduction year-on-year despite a single name charge relating to our U.K
   0.00 -1 TNAV reduced by -- in Q4, by 5p to 276p driven by the DTA write-down
   0.00  1 Within that, Personal was up significantly from Q3, while Barclaycard was down by a similar amount
   0.25  0 And both of these deltas were driven by one-off effects; effective interest-rate updates in Personal and remediation in Barclaycard
   0.00  1   With regards to balances, apart from the transfer of ESHLA loans from Non-Core in Q3, I would highlight the growth of GBP 1.4 billion in the mortgage book in Q4, to add to the GBP 2 billion of growth in Q3
   0.00  1 And deposits also continued to grow
   0.00  1 Digital engagement with our customers has reached record levels, with over 10 million digitally active customers and that's up 7% year-on-year
  -0.07  1 Risk appetite remained tightly controlled, and we saw a slight improvement in arrears rates in Cards, while impairment was up just GBP 4 million and the LLR down slightly
   0.00 -1 Overall BI's income and profits were down, as CIB's performance was affected by low volatility in client activity compared to a strong Q4 last year
   0.00 -1 The depreciation of the U.S
   0.00 -1 dollar was a material headwind and remained so in the first few weeks of this year
   0.11 -1 The year-on- year comparison was adversely affected by the dollar depreciation, but this has had beneficial effect on costs in sterling
  -0.11  0 We've combined credit and macro to give a FICC number for ease of comparison with our peers
  -0.11  0 The breakdown is in the Appendix, but from Q1, we will move to in line with peers and report just the FICC line
   0.00 -1 FICC income was down 21% in sterling terms but 14% translated into dollars
   0.00  1 Credit was up year-on-year, with improved performance in munis while macro was down sharply, typically in rates, reflecting record low levels of volatility, while last year's Q4 benefited from some pickup following the U.S
   0.00 -1 Equities was down 12% or 4% in dollar terms
   0.00  1 Banking fee performance reflected a strong print in DCM and was up 2% in dollar terms against a strong Q4 2016
   0.00 -1 Corporate lending was down, with lending balances reduced as we reallocated RWAs within the CIB, while transaction banking was broadly flat
   0.25  0 Net loans and advances in U.S
   0.00  1 The overall income growth of 1% year-on-year reflected good underlying growth in Cards, partly offset by the repositioning of the U.S
   0.00  1   We saw record volumes of payments processed in the merchant acquiring business, which also completed a migration of customers to new merchant acquiring platforms
  -0.08  1 We've seen some increase in underlying impairment year-on-year, but delinquencies are flat, including the benefit from the U.S
  -0.14  0 We're not concerned by this, but continue to monitor credit conditions carefully
   0.00  1 Cost increased by 10%, principally reflecting business growth and investment
   0.00 -1 Overall, the loss before tax was GBP 365 million compared to a profit of GBP 162 million in Q4 last year
   0.00 -1 Head Office RWAs were down significantly, principally reflecting the proportion consolidation of Africa
  -0.14  1 As shown on this slide, the 5% reduction in our cost base, excluding litigation and conduct from 2016 to 2017, the biggest driver of lower cost was a reduction in and closure of Non-Core
   0.06  0 The 2017 total of GBP 14.2 billion is in line with the guidance we gave at Q3 and reflected continued investments through Q4, which included cost-efficiency measures such as the branch optimization I mentioned in BUK
  -0.06  0 We've issued guidance for 2019 costs, excluding litigation and conduct, in the range of GBP 13.6 billion to GBP 13.9 billion, which is expected to deliver a group cost-income ratio of below 60%, and that still holds
   0.00  1 We do expect savings from the lower SRP costs as we complete the U.K
  -0.20  1 ring-fencing in H1 and lower costs for restructuring and Non-Core
   0.12  0 But we have also targeted investment spend throughout the year, and some of the cost efficiencies won't come through until later years
   0.25  0 Moving on to our capital position
   0.00  1 In Q4, we saw our CET1 ratio grow from 13.1% to 13.3%, which remains at our end-state target of around 13%
   0.00 -1   In terms of headwinds, we still have some residual litigation and conduct to resolve
  -0.27  1 Our intention to increase the 2018 dividend to 6.5p, subject to the usual regulatory approvals and stress test outcomes, is a clear statement of intent in this regard
   0.00  1 leverage ratio ended the year at 4.9%, well above our required level
   0.00 -1 We flagged some uncertainty as to whether the potential adverse impact of the so-called BEAT provisions would materially erode this positive effect
   0.33  0 effective tax rate
   0.08  0 Although there remain a number of uncertainties, and particularly around the BEAT provisions, we are now in a position to guide to a group ETR in the mid-20s for 2018 and for future periods
   0.33  0 We see this coming through with effect from Q1
   0.09  0 At Q3, we announced our preliminary estimate of the effect of implementation of IFRS 9 on both TNAV and the CET1 ratio
  -0.08  0 And since then, we have continued to refine our models and methodology, resulting in an increase in the impairment stock on the 1st of January 2018 of GBP 2.8 billion; the upper end of the range we indicated
   0.00 -1 Meanwhile, the reduction in U.S
   0.33  0 tax rates has had 2 effects
   0.00  1 The downside is that it reduces the value of the tax shield on this increase but it also lowers the tax in our U.S
   0.50  0 profits going forward
   0.25  0 The TNAV effect as at the 1st of January is now GBP 2.2 billion off 13p per share
   0.33  0 The other effect is that the U.S
   0.11  0 With transition, we'd expect the ultimate end effect to amount to a few basis points below this
   0.12  0 As we said in Q3, the effect of implementation does not have a major [ way ] in which we think about our capital flight path
  -0.22  0 We have therefore announced our intention to pay a dividend of 6.5p for 2018, subject to the usual regulatory approvals
   0.00  1 Cards and a resilient performance across CIB markets and banking businesses
   0.00 -1 The recent depreciation in the dollar is currently a headwind in terms of sterling results
   0.00  1 While the lower tax rate we are guiding now is a tailwind
   0.00  1 In terms of trading, we've mentioned that income in the CIB markets business is up year-to-date compared to the corresponding period last year, both in dollars and in sterling
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.50  0 And I imagine there's going to be quite a few questions
   0.00  1 So we feel confident of getting there without the tax cuts, the tax cuts is just a tailwind that will give us increased confidence
   0.33  0 Remember, we did say greater than 9%
   0.00  1 And we were just focused on the things that we can absolutely control, and that's growing our top line, strict cost control and allocating capital properly
   0.17  0 So it's going to be what it'll be, depending on the tax rates
   0.00  1 In the Card businesses, we see it was up 12% last year
   0.00  1 The American Airlines deal's rolling out extremely well
   0.25  0 Can I just stay with the Investment Bank piece, please
   0.00 -1 On a dollar basis, our markets, revenues were down 10%
   0.00 -1 I think the average in the United States, banks was down 21%
   0.00  1 But I would say in the fourth quarter, we gained market share
   0.00  1 We felt good about some market share gains we feel we got back in the fourth quarter
   0.00  1 It's been a decent start
  -0.20  0 You have another question on ring-fencing I think?  Yes
   0.00 -1 It's just on the ring-fencing, [ the launch is close ], but are there any issues -- and the one sort of in my mind is possible leverage requirement, that sort of affects your overall strategic thinking within that business
  -0.11  0 So I think we'll continue to operate in a world where we would expect [ to see ] CET1 as a front-stop measure in terms of managing our financial resources and leverage as a backstop measure which I believe is what was the intentions in the first place
   0.00  1 You've got to remember in our ring-fenced bank we do have a sizable Cards business, which helps soak up some of the leverage
  -0.11  0 If I could ask a couple of questions on capital, one in terms of lumpy items coming through in 2018
   0.20  0 You flagged the 10 basis points of benefit from BAGL
  -0.50  0 And then the second question attached to that
   0.08  0 I don't know, whether we retire -- and when and if we retire expensive debt out of the capital cost to them will be depending on prevailing FX rate
  -0.12  0 We are very focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders, and so that's first and foremost
   0.33  0 In terms of achieving the 9% or better RoTE number in 2019, earnings is a part of that
  -0.10  0 And thinking of CIB, we're pretty much looking at just a reallocation of existing RWAs as opposed to growth
  -0.25  0 You restated your capital target of 14% today
  -0.12  0 The second question is just a quick follow-up on your recent disclosure on the U.S
   0.00 -1 IHC, and I know there has been a considerable reduction in assets
   0.20  0 We're trying to be as transparent as we can on how we see our capital stack
   0.06  0 Some banks will have domestic SIFI-type surcharges, we have a global systemic surcharge and we'll have different Pillar 2As, we'll have different effects of countercyclical buffers, et cetera
   0.33  0 So we've tried to be very transparent
   0.10  0 When you look at our stack, and everything we can see and what we know today, and you add about 150 to 200 basis points above that, we get into the low -- sort of low [ 13s ] effectively
  -0.25  0 The other way, is obviously, looking at stress draw
  -0.12  0 And where we are today, you can broadly speak and take about a 500 basis point stress draw and still remain above the systemic reference point of the Bank of England and that's at the sort of the upper end of the stress tests that we've experienced thus far, obviously we run our own stress tests, sometimes they are more conservative than the Bank of England
  -0.08  0 And of course, including that stress test draw, there is a -- obviously a meaningful component for conduct given the issues that we've been dealing with in the past
   0.07  0 And we'll be as transparent as we can, and we'll let you know if there's anything that we're seeing on the horizon that feels we need to refine that in any way and hopefully you've seen us do that over the years
  -0.14  0 But obviously as we've had questions over the years about leverage ratio and asset mix in the IHC
   0.00  1 And I've always said to you that we'll have the IHC appropriately capitalized in time for a public CCAR test
   0.20  0 And there's not a huge incentive to do it too far in advance of that
   0.00  1 And that's going well
   0.00  1 So we feel very good about that
   0.00  1 And really, what Tushar and I want to do is, when we say something to our analysts, our shareholders, we deliver it, so we build that credibility
  -0.08  0 banks, in part because of the role of stress testing, I think you'll increasingly see across the industry buybacks play a role in returning capital
  -0.12  1 And if you look at Barclays, specifically, given where our stock is, for sure, the economics around the buyback program are quite compelling
  -1.00  0 Just two questions
  -0.25  0 And the second question is on Barclays U.K
  -0.03  0 Yes, so your group NIM for -- [ exactly ] as you laid out, it's quite tricky to think of group NIM as sort of blended number because of the various [indiscernible] parts of it the way you sort of went around house in some ways the U.K., CC&P and then our sort of weighted average funding cost is the right way to think about it
   0.00 -1 And the backdrop, of course, is asset margin pressure is still pretty competitive, and we'll see if that remained
  -0.25  0 So there are sort of 2 sort of forces going on there
   0.00  1 We actually feel pretty good with the way our NIMs held up in light of that asset margin pressure
   0.00  1 So we're operating in a part of the mortgage business that we like a lot, and it's very accretive to our business
   0.00  1 And you can see that the parts of the book that are growing well
   0.00  1 Things like American, JetBlue tend to be more prime-oriented products, but the growth is very good there as well
   0.00  1 So you put that all together, I think NIM will continue to be   at reasonably healthy levels, really driven as much by growth
   0.00 -1 We did a HoldCo year or senior earlier in this year, and I think it was tighter spreads that we've seen
   0.00  1 We feel really good about that
   0.00  1 We do run a relatively conservative loan-to-deposit ratio where we have a very strong liquidity position
   0.00  1 But if we took that loan-to-deposit ratio to over 100%, which some of our peers do, of course, that'll be very accretive to the cost-income ratio, but gives you a sort of a different risk profile
   0.00  1  That's a good one to model
   0.00  1 The consumers are over geared, but economy is pretty good, money is pretty cheap
   0.00  1 You're growing ahead of the market in mortgages
   0.00 -1 We have been probably a bit more cautious than some of the larger U.K
   0.00  1 And what that's really meant for us is we just stick to the business we know well and concentrate on that, and therefore, you can see sort of growth in mortgages
   0.00  1 So you see our name hopefully as a branding matter out there, but the business that we're printing is very much in our sweet spot, and we haven't changed that risk appetite for some time
   0.00  1 And   even if we were to grow our unsecured book, it's taken us 50-odd years to get to the sort of receivables that we have, and it takes a long time to grow that business
   0.00 -1 economy and to the U.K
   0.00  1 Right now, we're doing very well
   0.00  1 Impairment is at a very manageable level, profitability is at a very acceptable level
   0.00 -1 So I think we've been properly cautious in the U.K
   0.00  1 Cards business early on in '17, the dropout of the lower part of that portfolio in hindsight was terrific
  -0.33  0  Jon? [Operator Instructions]  Two questions, again
  -0.09  1 Since the sale of that portfolio earlier last year, the delinquencies have gone up by about 40 basis points, 30-day plus arrears, and that's despite about 15% growth in the books
   0.00  1 The second question, it's going back to this bullet point, this is the first time I've seen it in Jes' slide on the 60 basis points potential benefit in International, I mean, your total wholesale funding is GBP 157 billion, I assume most of it is in International, so that sounds like we're talking sort of GBP 700 million, maybe GBP 800 million worth of uplift in revenue from that
  -0.14  1 But if you look at the delinquencies on that book, that was good timing, so hats off to the business for timing that very well
   0.00  1 A very good transaction
   0.00  1 So the airlines, whether it's Alaskan, Hawaiian and JetBlue, and those guys are growing well
   0.00  1 So it gives us the right mix of yield but a lot of the right risk characteristics
  -0.11  0 So although we're watching credit conditions carefully, we're not at all really concerned by them at this stage
  -0.25  0 So it's something we're very mindful of, but not concerned as yet
   0.00  1 It's really the -- if spreads stay where they are, and we continue refinancing as we've done, we are able to refinance it at a lower levels
  -0.08  1 When we look at our returns objective, it's just yet another, at today's spread levels, a nice tailwind that we've got going for us
  -0.10  0 We can see at the group level, how much is term fund?  Yes, look, we haven't disclosed that so I won't throw it out here
   0.18  0 You probably could back into what the wholesale funding is effectively in BI and do your own sums, but don't think of it as an instantaneous refinancing benefit
   0.00 -1 And I guess, just going back to Martin's comment, I mean, if I benchmark you really against any of your peers, I think you've got the lowest Core Tier 1s in the U.K
   0.00 -1 Your PPI is lower than a number of people, you might need to top that up
   0.00 -1 You've got the IFRS headwinds
  -0.17  0 So I'm just trying to square the sort of tone of your comments that are so specific with when I look at the numbers, it doesn't seem to quite bear that out in quite the same way
   0.00  1 If you accept consensus forecast of EPS for '20, so let's say, '19 or even 2018, and put that into basis points for CET1, you'll get over 100 points of CET1 just on consensus number in terms of organic capital generation, notwithstanding we still got some tailwinds from Non-Core and Africa and various other things that we -- you'd expect us to manage
  -0.04  0 So every which way I look at it is there's enough capital generation in the company to support the distribution that Jes has talked about to finance growth in the areas that we'd like to prioritize, which aren't hugely capital-consumptive, and deal with headwinds that we may have, for example, dealing with any legacy litigation
   0.17  0 And you've seen our capital stack, we'll continue to be as transparent as we can about that
   0.20  0 But at the moment, everything we can see allows us to discharge all of those effects comfortably
   0.00 -1  So I guess -- so from your perspective, if I look at Slide 15, the 4 basis points you think is a unusually low number for Q4?  Yes, look, our Q4 is seasonally low in terms of -- because the bank levy goes in, in a single quarter so you always have that
   0.00  1 If you see that our capital ratio, I think I'm probably going to get this [ off ], IR will correct me here, but I think 11 after the last 13 quarters or something like that our capital ratio has improved
  -0.15  0 I mean, you referred to and it sounds like it's pretty important to get to result of the litigation, legacy litigation, to be able to contemplate share buybacks
   1.00  0 I have two, please
  -0.14  0 Obviously, you're not going to be able to deploy that excess funding elsewhere in the business going forward
   0.00 -1 You said that markets is, so far, trending up in sterling terms, but that's relative to a pretty soft 1Q comp last year
   0.00 -1 So it's a bigger headwind in equity, bigger in IBD, bigger in CC&P
   0.00 -1 Consensus has International revenues up year-over-year, is that realistic in light of your comments that we do need to factor in this FX headwind?  Yes
   0.00  1 We do get very good deposit growth
   0.00  1 You've seen that we grew deposits over the course of the year even though rate rises happened, so that helps manage our LDR
  -0.08  0 And we quite like the LDR somewhere around 100 or below is probably where we'd feel comfortable running it, and we'll keep you updated on that
   0.09  0 dollars, and so hopefully that gives you enough of an insight as to what's going on in the International business to model that against whatever FX rates you may want to assume
   0.12  0 That's about half of our income and about 40% of the profit for the group, and FX rates will be what they'll be
  -0.22  0 Anybody on the phone wants to ask a question? We do not have any questions registered on the telephone
  -0.14  0 So on both the Non-Core, yes, the trend is floating downwards for sure
   0.00 -1 It wasn't significant in the fourth quarter to the extent -- I mean, somewhat driven by markets and what have you, so it's very hard to predict precisely quarter
  -0.11  0 We didn't talk about it at all in the fourth quarter, and I don't think you'll be hearing too much about it as we go through the year, subject to market changes
   0.00 -1 Because of our U.K
   0.13  0 bank relative to the whole group, it translates to a 50 basis point effect for the whole group, so that's effectively assuming a 400 basis points as is supplied by the [ SEC ] banking and PRA
   0.00 -1 I was just wondering a couple of things
  -0.08  1 And then just as a broader question, again, we heard a lot from Lloyds yesterday about the future with Open Banking, and they think that they're going to be a significant beneficiary of this increased competition
   0.25  0 Or whether you see this as an opportunity to take share?  Yes, all right
  -0.33  0 Our legacy trackers, unfortunately, aren't so negligible
   0.12  0 Again, we don't quote that, but in some ways, the SVR benefit -- the reverse of that is probably what's going on
  -0.12  0 In Barclays back book, we have a higher proportion of legacy trackers that are very low yielding, and unfortunately, very small book of high-yielding SVR
   0.50  0 So it still is accretive effectively
   0.00  1 And Open Banking, look, we run -- we'll see, one of the things I think that we've done a really good job in the U.K
   0.22  0 business, particularly under Ashok's leadership, is how we've progressed our digital offering
   0.00  1 We think we've got the best mobile app out there
   0.00  1 We -- the production that we have in consumer loans and personal lending is probably higher through our app and simpler through our app than we believe some of our competitors, we've got an API store out there that allows other retailers and other providers to connect to Barclays in a very safe and secure way
   0.00  1 So we think we're well -- I'm sorry? [indiscernible]    Yes, yes
   0.11  0  Yes, I think if you think about it is the FinTech company is an innovator looking for a scaled distribution platform
  -0.12  0 Maybe one on detail and one sort of broader question on the IB
   0.00 -1 Tushar, if you look at Slide 36, the rate sensitivity, which you've been very helpful with in terms of the analysis on year 1 to year 3, seems to have gone down a little bit from the last time we published
   0.00 -1 I was wondering if you might give us any thoughts on why that's gone down even though it still shows you're very rate sensitive
  -0.18  0 And what do you think are the 3 areas really kind of driving, let's say, the lack of underperformance?  Yes
   0.00  1 If we do get the number of rate rises and get anywhere near 2%, it's a good environment for us to be, assuming the economy is healthy, that's really the point we wanted to make
  -0.18  0    To the larger question, as Tim and I have talked about -- to course correct the CIB, it's people, it's technology and balance sheet, not RWA
   0.00  1 In U.S., our market share in Tradeweb, which you can track for clearing [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] 0.7% when we launched this thing, we're now over 10%
   0.00  1 Still got a ways to go, but I think we feel pretty good to have the journey just begun
  -0.20  0  We'll take a couple of questions, and we'll..
  -0.20  0 We'll just take one more question, and [ then I do think ] we need to pack up
  -0.12  1 Second question is in relation to the -- in relation to your credit [indiscernible] arrears which improved in 4Q
  -0.25  0 Card, the -- so the delinquency is just nudging down slightly, flat to down
   0.00 -1 I mean, it still feels like a early, benign credit environment as best as we can see it in consumer credit
  -0.14  0 Yes, I mean, obviously, the big thing on the horizon, but quite some way out, is Basel IV, so to speak
  -0.17  0 We'll do a couple of questions outside, but thanks a lot, everyone
   0.00  1 Thank you

    Differences: 226/641


---FILE: BP p.l.c..txt

   0.00  1 Well, a very big hello and welcome to BP's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results and an update on BP's strategy
  -0.33  1 And we have quite a few people signed up, so a big welcome
  -0.17  0 I know it's very early in the morning or late in the evening for some of you, so a particular thank you to you
  -0.12  1 I know the markets, in general, are a little bit turbulent, so I hope we can give you some good news today
   0.12  0 Just to remind you, we are a very long-term industry, and we will keep advancing through the -- any rough waters that the markets send us
  -0.17  0 So before I begin, I need to draw your attention to the cautionary statement
   0.25  0 It is long and detailed but necessary, so please have a read of it when you have a moment
   0.14  0 And you'll hear from me first with an overview of our progress against the strategy we laid out a year ago
   0.08  0 Lamar will focus specifically on our approach to the energy transition and what BP is doing across our businesses to adapt and position ourself for a lower-carbon future
   0.00  1 That will provide you with some wider context for the updates from Bernard and Tufan on how the Upstream and the Downstream plans and the portfolios are evolving over the medium term as well as what we're doing to create and deliver long-term growth prospects
  -0.10  0 We'll then take a short break, and we'll return, and I'll provide a summary before moving to Qs and As
   0.17  0 So let's start with an overview of our strategic progress in 2017
   0.00  1 At the start of the year, we told you 2017 would be very important for the company, a significant year of disciplined execution and growth across the businesses
  -0.20  0 You might recall, we said we would start up 7 major projects in the Upstream this year
   0.00  1 These projects, along with the ramp-up of 6 start-ups in 2016, have contributed to a 10% year-on-year increase in BP's reported production
   0.00  1 We had our best reserve replacement ratio in over a decade, estimated at 143%
   0.00 -1 And we sanctioned 3 new projects in Trinidad, India and the Gulf of Mexico
   0.00  1 We've also seen strong growth in the Downstream
   0.00  1 They've done that through continued volume growth in premium fuels and lubricants; the strong performance of our refining operations, averaging more than 95% availability across the year; and earnings growth of over 10% in fuels marketing
   0.00  1 We now have around 1,100 retail convenience partnership sites around the world, and we have plans to continue to grow our retail network across existing markets as well as new markets, such as India, Indonesia, Mexico and China
   0.00  1 We also grew our alternative energy business, with availability around 95% resulting in strong operating cash flows in 2017
   0.00  1 We're combining our scale, our relationships around the world and expertise in major projects with Lightsource's expertise in developing solar projects
  -0.33  0 Total divestments and other proceeds were $4.3 billion
   0.00  1 So far this year, Brent's oil prices averaged almost $70 per barrel, up from an average of $54 in 2017, a year which was hard to believe the first average annual increase since 2012
   0.17 -1 But our expectation is that some of this recent strength could be short lived, and then prices will moderate over the medium term
   0.00  1 In terms of outlook, the base case of our 2017 energy outlook expects that global energy demand will grow
   0.00  1 It will grow by up around 1/3 over the next 2 decades
   0.11  0 Virtually all of that demand is to come from emerging economies, notably China and India, driven by rising prosperity
   0.00 -1 And the rate of growth will then slow down compared to past decades as the energy transition evolves, and there's increasing attention on energy sustainability and efficiency
   0.00  1 And as fast as renewables and clean energy can grow, faster than any fuel in history, the world is going to require gas and oil for some decades to come to fill much of its energy demand
   0.00  1 In BP, we have been committed to the low-carbon transition for a long time, and we've gained a lot of experience along the way that we're putting to good use
   0.00  1 We're reducing our own emissions through operational emission-reduction activities
  -0.06  1 There's a lot of uncertainty around the pace and the direction of change, probably more than at any time I can recall, but we have a strong and a flexible platform to build on, giving us the ability to adapt quickly in any environment
   0.11  0 You'll hear more detail from Lamar later on what we've been doing around advancing the energy transition
   0.00  1 These all underpin our aim of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to our shareholders over the long term, and I'll take each of these in turn in a bit more detail
   0.00  1 It's a core value and our #1 priority
  -0.13  1 We are also focused on learning, investigating safety incidents and using leading indicators to monitor and strengthen the controls we have in place to prevent future incidents
   0.00  1 We see this coming through in our strong operating reliability numbers, which was 95% in both the Upstream and the Downstream in 2017
  -0.12  0 It's on time and under budget, with 0 days away from work due to injury last year
   0.20  0 Now a second element of the proposition is what we believe is a distinctive portfolio
   0.00  1 It's a business portfolio that drives value creation today and has deep and flexible options to support future growth
  -0.09  1 But importantly, this is balanced with production from fixed price or similar contracts, which provide a base of steady, resilient, long-term cash flow
   0.00  1 We also have a strong and differentiated Downstream business, which some of you may be familiar with, if you joined Tufan and his team at his Investor Day at our Downstream technology center in Pangbourne last June
   0.00  1 It's a significant addition to the wind and biofuels businesses in our alternative energy portfolio
   0.00  1 We have one of the largest operated renewables portfolios among our peers, and we are selectively investing in emerging new businesses and technologies to ensure we stay at the forefront of changing global needs and the energy transition
   0.10  0 Another highly distinctive aspect of our portfolio is our strategic partnership with Russia's largest oil company
   0.10  0 We also received $314 million of dividends, supported by the recent changes in the dividend policy there to pay out at least 50% of IFRS net profit
  -0.25  0 We currently have interests -- some of you have asked this question
   0.00  1 Field's currently producing about 25,000 barrels a day, and expansion is expected to start up this year in '18 and raise production to over 100,000 barrels a day by 2021
   0.08  0 In addition, we're developing and applying new methods of production to improve the mature oil fields as we did with TNK-BP as well as refining
   0.00  1 So first, as you'll have heard me say many times and Brian, it is a continuous drive to simplify and reduce our costs without, in any way, compromising on safety
   0.00  1 Second is to be very disciplined on capital investment in both the Upstream and the Downstream
   0.00  1 We manage for value over the long term, seeking new ways to grow returns inorganically
   0.05  0 Two recent examples are the transaction in the Norwegian North Sea to create Aker BP and the merger of BP and Bridas to create Argentina's largest private integrated oil and gas company, Pan American Energy
   0.00  1 As our Upstream and our Downstream businesses' earnings grow, cash grows, return on average capital employed, or ROACE, more than doubled in 2017 versus a year ago
   0.00  1 It's up to 5.8%, obviously still a long way to go
   0.00  1 As volumes and margins continue to go across our operating businesses, we expect our ROACE to recover steadily and exceed 10% by 2021
   0.00  1 As you'll see from the results in a moment, our 5-year plan is delivering results
   0.00  1 We have a clear set of strategic priorities that are shaping how we will continue to generate value in a rapidly changing world
   0.00  1 We're doing this across our operating businesses and by leveraging our existing knowledge from the developments of our alternative energy businesses
   0.14  0 Underlying replacement cost profit was $2.1 billion compared with $400 million in the same period a year ago and $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2017
   0.11  0 In Upstream, the fourth quarter underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax of $2.2 billion compares with $400 million a year ago and $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2017
  -0.07  1 Compared to the third quarter, the result reflects higher liquids realizations along with higher production from major project   start-ups, partly offset by higher exploration write-offs
   0.00  1 Fourth quarter reported production was 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 18% higher than a year ago
  -0.05  0 Looking ahead, we expect first quarter 2018 reported production to be broadly flat with the fourth quarter, reflecting continued ramp-up from 2017 major project start-ups, offset by the exploration of the Adma concession and other divestment and portfolio impacts
   0.12  0 The fourth quarter underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax was $1.5 billion compared with $900 million a year ago and $2.3 billion in the third quarter
  -0.03  1 Compared to the third quarter, the result reflects stronger refining performance, with availability at 96.1%, the highest in over a decade, more than offset by a slightly below break-even performance in oil supply and trading, seasonally lower industry refining margins and fuels marketing results, more turnaround activity and, of course, the absence of earnings following the divestment of the SECCO joint venture in our petrochemicals business
   0.00 -1 Looking to first quarter of 2018, we expect higher discounts for North American heavy crude oil but lower industry refining margins
   0.00 -1 We also expect turnaround activity to be lower in refining but significantly higher in petrochemicals
  -0.14  1 This was higher than our guidance of $350 million as a result of adverse foreign exchange impacts
   0.25  0 The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27%
  -0.14  1 This reflects a benefit from the reassessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets
   0.20  0 The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 38%
  -0.06  0 Divestments and other proceeds for the full year totaled $4.3 billion, with $3.4 billion received in the fourth quarter, including total proceeds of $1.5 billion following the sale of our SECCO business in China and around $800 million from the initial public offering of BP Midstream Partners
   0.00  1 We expect Upstream full year 2018 underlying production to be higher than 2017, driven by the continued ramp-up of 2017 major projects as well as the 6 major project start-ups we have planned in 2018
   0.00  1 The total DD&A charge is expected to be higher than 2017, reflecting the start-up of major projects and continued growth in Upstream production volumes
   0.14  0   In the current environment, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be above 40%
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet remains robust, and we will continue to target a gearing band of 20% to 30%
   0.00  1 In 2017, underlying operating cash flow more than covered organic capital expenditure and the cash dividend in the year at an average Brent oil price of $54 per barrel
   0.00  1 The organic cash breakeven for the group was $46 per barrel or the equivalent of $53 per barrel on a full dividend basis, including scrip, and that was ahead of where we anticipated we would be with the plan
   0.00  1 Within a disciplined capital frame and with continuing growth in operating cash flow from the Upstream and Downstream, we expect the organic breakeven for the group to average around $50 per barrel on a full dividend basis in 2018
   0.00 -1 Looking further out, as we've said before, this is expected to reduce steadily to $35 to $40 per barrel by 2021
  -0.11  0 Looking ahead, our intent will be to offset any ongoing scrip dilution through further buybacks over time
   0.00  1 Our disciplined capital frame of $15 billion to $17 billion remains robust
  -0.12  1 We will ensure we remain robust to the downside in the event oil prices were to drop below $50 per barrel
  -0.20  0 Around $1.2 billion has already been paid out in the first quarter for the scheduled criminal settlement payment, which now concludes the payments around the original criminal settlement
  -0.17  0 Divestment proceeds in 2018 are expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion per year, with proceeds weighted towards the second half of the year again
  -0.08  1 Longer term, we expect divestments to remain in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion per year as we optimize and high-grade our portfolio and, of course, create flexibility within our financial frame
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect gearing to remain within the 20% to 30% band over time
   0.00  1 The group's financial framework remains resilient
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Now, as Bob outlined earlier, how we do that is by setting clearer strategic priorities and vigorously pursuing these
   0.00  1 We also, of course, consider the timing and implications of changing patterns of demand and use this to plan around distinct horizons: things we're doing in the near term to make the business more resilient, as Brian talked about; things we're doing into the next decade and beyond to deliver growth; and things we're starting to do to secure our energy future over the much longer term
   0.22  0 Our approach, reduce, improve, create, which Bob mentioned earlier, consists of the 3 distinct elements
   0.00  1 First, reducing the emissions from our own operations
  -0.12  1 Now I need to be clear here, this is a complex subject, and our total emissions may well grow in the coming years as our production grows
  -0.06  0 However, we are actively looking for ways to limit the growth of emissions everywhere we can, with a focus on reducing our operation -- our emissions at an operational level, and that's what we're talking about when we say reduce
   0.33  0 We're integrating energy efficiency into the design of new projects
   0.12  0 We designed our Khazzan gas operation in Oman to be inherently efficient and very low in emissions
   0.00  1 Our work to reduce flaring is an example of this
   0.00  1 Providing lower-carbon products to our customers is one of the biggest contributions we can make
  -0.17  0 transport, making fuel from agricultural and food waste
   0.00  1 The third element includes growing our established renewable portfolio and creating low-carbon businesses by investing in high-tech low-carbon start-ups and developing new business models and offers
   0.00  1 That helps accelerate and commercialize new technologies, products and business models
   0.12  0 Those areas are: advanced mobility; bio and low-carbon products; carbon management; power and storage; and digital
   0.00  1 Now these were deliberately selected as they're aligned to our commitment of advancing the energy transition, and they provide opportunities that are also aligned with our core businesses, allowing us to exploit portfolio adjacencies and build resilience within existing operations
   0.11  0 Our approach is enabled by strategic partnerships, large-scale products -- sorry, large-scale projects, venturing and experimentation
   0.00  1 And by 2035, we estimate that they could grow to more than 10% of total energy demand
   0.00  1 And as you know and as Bob mentioned, we've already established and have a growing low-carbon business in what we call alternative energy
   0.00  1 But we're expanding the reach of this business
  -0.14  0 Our biopower business, which is -- sits within renewable power platform, exploits adjacencies here
  -0.10  0 It generates enough electricity from the waste sugarcane to power our 3 ethanol plants while exporting the remaining 70% to the local electricity grid
   0.00  1 We estimate that solar could generate up to 10% of total global power by 2035, and we see significant commercial potential in targeting this demand growth together with a partner which has aligned aspirations
   0.00  1 Lightsource BP is a global leader in the development, acquisition and long-term management of large-scale solar projects and smart energy solutions
   0.00  1 Renewable products is the third and emerging platform within the alternative energy portfolio
   0.08  0 Now we're also developing new low-carbon and digital businesses, and our portfolio of opportunities today includes a pipeline of more than 35 active investments with more than 200 coinvestors
   0.00  1 With about 1/7 of the world's greenhouse gas emissions now covered by carbon pricing systems, we anticipate further growth in this area
   0.00  1 As discussed in our 2017 energy outlook, nearly 2/3 of the growth -- projected growth in world energy demand over the coming decades could come and probably will come in the form of electricity
  -0.25  0 We recently invested in a company called Beyond Limits
  -0.05  0 It's a leader in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, and we're working together to apply technologies developed and pioneered in space to the extreme environments that we operate within, such as deepwater exploration and production
   0.00  1 Our commitment to help -- helping drive the energy transition is embedded in the core of our business strategy
   0.07  0 Now in the early stages of incubation, we don't expect immediate profits; however, where they pass materiality and return thresholds, we will look to take the investments forward, growing and commercializing them
   0.20  0 So with that, I'll pass you over to Bernard, so he can talk about the strategic progress in the Upstream
   0.00  1 Last February, consistent with this strategy, we set out clear guidance for our plan to 2021, and the key metrics are highlighted on this slide: 5% production growth; $13 billion to $14 billion per annum of organic capital expenditure; resulting in about $13 billion to $14 billion in pretax free cash flow in 2021
   0.00  1   Now in 2017, we took significant steps, I think, towards these goals with a very strong year of delivery
   0.00  1 In total, from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2017, we installed more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day production capacity from our major projects, a very significant year of delivery as we marched towards our 2020 guidance of 800,000 barrels per day
   0.00  1 Second, we grew production 12% versus 2016
   0.00  1 This was ahead of our plan, with production growth accelerated into 2017
   0.00  1 Underlying growth was 8%
   0.09  0 Importantly, we continue to maintain a laser focus on the efficiency of our spend, and I will share a little bit more on this later
   0.00  1 Fourth, all of this helped us generate $6.9 billion of pretax free cash flow, an increase of around $8.5 billion on 2016
  -0.02  0 Examples include in Azerbaijan, where we agreed a 25-year extension to the ACG production-sharing agreement out to 2049; we also extended the In Amenas production-sharing contract in Algeria; in Brazil, where we accessed the prolific Santos basin and signed a letter of intent with Petrobras to jointly identify and evaluate business opportunities, Tufan and I just came back from there last week; on the other side of the Atlantic, where we accessed new acreage in Côte d'Ivoire; and just last month in Sao Tome and Principe; and in Norway, where our Aker BP joint venture continued its remarkable growth through acquiring Hess Norge
   0.00  1 We also had a good year of exploration
   0.00  1 Our performance in 2017 was underpinned by continued strong functional execution, helping us get the most out of every dollar we spend
   0.00  1 This is one of the factors which has helped reduce unit development costs in drilling by 34% since 2013
   0.00  1 We also continue to actively manage our base business, a source of enormous value
   0.00  1 With the delivery of the 7 projects in 2017, we are well on track now for the 800,000 barrels per day of production in 2020
   0.14  0 The majority of the projects are already under construction and are, on average, under budget and on schedule
   0.00  1 Today, we now extend this high- quality growth from projects to 2021, where we expect 900,000 barrels per day
   0.00  1 And importantly, this production is expected to come with the same 35% higher cash margins, on average, than our 2015 base portfolio
   0.00  1 In 2018, we intend to build on last year's delivery with another year of disciplined growth
   0.00  1 We expect underlying production growth of between 5% and 7%
   0.07 -1 Reported growth will be lower than this due to portfolio effects, including the expiry of the Adma concession and our dilution in Pan America Energy, ACG and the Magnus field
   0.00 -1   We expect our organic capital expenditure in 2018 to be $12 billion to $13 billion, below our guidance, while maintaining our growth targets
   0.00  1 This is driven by improved capital productivity, importantly, not in absence of growth options
   0.00  1 We expect to start up around 6 major projects and take a number of final investment decisions on projects, including developments in Oman, India, Trinidad and the North Sea, high-quality projects that we expect to further underpin growth through 2021 and beyond
   0.00  1 Taking these together, we expect pretax free cash flow growth in 2018 to be higher than 2017 without any help from the oil price
   0.00  1 As we shared in Baku in 2016, we firmly believe, and Bob mentioned earlier, we have the capacity for quality growth out to 2030 without the need for acquisitions
  -0.17  0 Let's take a scenario, and it's just a scenario, whereby we wish to overcome this decline and grow by, let's say, 1% from 2021 to 2025
   0.25  0 In that scenario, we expect to progress around 4 billion barrels
   0.00  1 On the right of the chart, you can see how we test each investment decision to ensure it is accretive to cash margin per barrel or accretive to DD&A or both, and this is all about driving higher returns into the business
   0.00  1 And in our plans right now, the combined production of these 2 basins will be higher in 2025 than they are today without any new exploration
   0.00  1 Oman Khazzan and the Lower 48 are examples of huge gas resource bases with long, steady cash flows
   0.00  1 The Khazzan project has competitive development costs, around 2/3 below our average, and competitive cash margins
   0.00  1 And within this, we have identified around 1,300 wells we can drill in high-quality plays with rates of return above our 20% hurdle
   0.00  1 This gives us the option to grow production from around 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent today to in excess of 400,000 barrels a day by 2025, all depending upon investment levels
   0.12  0 And as Bob said, we will continue to explore in pursuit of gas and advantaged oil but with real discipline
   0.00  1 The objective is to discover barrels which are better than the barrels we have today as well as to keep our facilities full
   0.00  1 When initially deployed on 180 wells and 5 pads, it reduced emissions by 74%, increased production by 20% and reduced cost by 22%
   0.00  1 There are lots more examples, as you can see on this slide, but overall, I remain excited by both the delivery but, very importantly, the potential that lies ahead in this agenda
   0.00  1 2021 delivery has been materially, I think, de-risked, and we are ahead of plan
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Good morning
   0.14  0 Today, I will provide you with an update of progress against strategy and the key metrics I set out last year
   0.00  1 Between 2014 and '16, we delivered $3 billion of underlying earnings growth
   0.00  1 Indeed, in 2017, we delivered our best overall safety performance on record
   0.09  0 In addition, we are developing new products, offers and business models to support the transition to a lower carbon and digitally enabled future
   0.33  0 So let me now take you through the progress in 2017
   0.00  1 The disciplined execution of our strategy continues to deliver results
   0.00  1 If you look at the chart on the left, you can see 2017 earnings stood at $7 billion, around 60% higher than 2014 despite an adverse environment impact of around $0.9 billion from narrower North American heavy crude oil differentials known as WTI-WCS
   0.00  1 The result for 2017 reflects $0.7 billion of underlying earnings growth, bringing total earnings growth to $3.7 billion since 2014
   0.00  1 And if you look at the chart on the right, it shows the drivers of this growth
   0.00  1 As you can see, 2017 was another year of strong performance from our marketing and manufacturing businesses
   0.00  1 Together, they delivered around $1 billion of underlying earnings growth, putting us ahead of plan to deliver the more than $3 billion growth we expect from these businesses by 2021
   0.00  1 Our supply and trading business delivers material and rateable earnings with some volatility across the years based on market opportunities
   0.00 -1 In 2017, we saw a lower contribution than the previous year, although still in line with 2014 earnings
   0.00  1 Last year, we spoke about the key drivers of earnings growth across each of our businesses
   0.33  0 Let me now share the progress we have made
   0.00  1 In marketing, we delivered further growth with earnings standing at almost $4 billion in 2017 and returns remaining highly attractive in excess of 30%
   0.00  1 In fuels marketing, we continued our track record of double-digit growth with underlying earnings in 2017 growing by $0.3 billion to $2.4 billion
   0.00  1 In fact, if you look at since 2014, we have grown fuels marketing earnings by more than 50% at constant currencies
   0.00  1 We now have 1,100 convenience partnership sites, a growth of more than 220 in 2017
   0.00  1 Indeed, in Mexico, we now have more than 130 operational sites after becoming the first international company to enter the deregulated fuel retail market last year, and we plan to grow to around 1,500 sites by 2021
   0.00  1 This is part of a focus growth strategy to expand our retail presence in China from 700 to around 2,500 sites
   0.00  1 We also continue to grow B2B fuels and Air BP businesses
   0.00  1 Our lubricants business is also differentiated
   0.00  1 In 2017, we delivered earnings of $1.5 billion with highly competitive return on sales of more than 20%
  -0.11  1 Our lubricants business has good exposure to growth markets and a growing premium segment, which delivered continued underlying earnings growth in 2017, although offset by the adverse lag impacts of increasing base oil prices
   0.00  1   Indeed, premium lubricants volumes grew to 44%, more than 1 percentage point increase versus 2016
   0.00  1 And in the fourth quarter, we saw a return to year-on-year earnings growth with key growth markets earnings increasing by 9%
   0.12  0 In addition to the continuation of Renault Formula One sponsorship and the supply of fuels and lubricants by BP, the partnership will also include a strategic collaboration for advanced mobility solutions
   0.00  1 Underlying earnings have grown by $0.8 billion in the year: $0.7 billion from refining; $0.1 billion from petrochemicals
   0.00  1 Delivery has been underpinned by strong operational performance in both refining and petrochemicals
   0.00  1 In petrochemicals, reducing cash breakeven is key to improving resilience to environmental volatility
   0.00  1 Our best on record are fast approaching our target of around 20%
   0.00  1 Indeed, a 2021 plan assumptions, 2017 free cash flow would have been $6.9 billion with returns of more than 19%, all of which makes our business even more resilient to the environment
   0.00 -1 If you look at the chart on the far right, you will see that we have further reduced the BP refining market margin to deliver 15% returns from $12 per barrel in 2016 to $11.5 per barrel in 2017
   0.00  1 This means we are able to sustainably deliver strong returns even at industry refining margins below the historic range
   0.05  0   And in the third area of creating new low-carbon businesses, we use the strategic frame shown on the slide to develop new customer offers and transition our business to a lower carbon future in the 3 focus areas of advanced mobility, bio and low carbon products and digital
   0.20  0 Let me now play a short video to share just some of the progress we have made
   0.00  1 We expect these initiatives and the other projects we have in the pipeline to create new business models and additional future revenue streams for Downstream over the longer term
   0.00  1 Our strategy continues to deliver results
   0.00  1 2017 was our best safety performance on record
   0.00  1 We delivered around $1 billion of underlying earnings growth in our marketing and manufacturing businesses and $1.1 billion of free cash flow growth with returns of more than 18%
   0.00  1 This strong 2017 delivery puts us ahead of plan to deliver more than $3 billion of underlying earnings growth by 2021 and between $9 billion to $10 billion of pretax free cash flow with returns of around 20% in 2021
   0.00  1 Thanks for listening
  -0.50  0 Now we will have 15 minutes break
  -0.33  0 After the break -- by the way, refreshments are outside
  -0.20  0 After the break, Bob will briefly summarize, then we will move to Q&A
  -0.50  0 [Break]  Okay
   0.14  0 We've showed you lots of data information, charts and slides, and I hope we've provided you a lot of useful information about the business and our direction
   0.00 -1 So calm down, everybody
   0.00  1 And BP is green on the screen, which is a nice surprise
   0.00  1 So our goal here is to keep growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions for our shareholders over the long term, and we believe we're in the right shape to do that now
   0.00  1 It's taking a long time, but I think we're in the right shape to do that now
   0.00  1 And as you've heard from Brian, we're back in balance and our financial frame is not just robust, it gives us room to maneuver when we see the right options
  -0.20  0 We're open for all kinds of questions about that future
   0.00  1 We'll also do so safely, first and foremost, and we're   going to maintain our discipline
   0.00 -1 The world is changing very, very fast, and there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the future looks like and what it looks like
  -0.25  0 We've been tested under fire a lot
   0.09  0 BP is a global integrated energy business, has over 100 years of experience of meeting society's demand for energy, which has all changed during that 100 years as well
   0.00  1 We've got an outstanding team
   0.00  1 And thank you all for listening
  -0.20  0 Staying with us now, over to you for questions here in the room and on the line
  -0.17  0 We'll take questions here in London, and we'll also have phone calls from the line
   0.12  0 Secondly, coming back to Macondo and the cash outflows, perhaps we can just talk about the line of sight, the confidence
   0.17  0 I want to know what the price is in terms of the unit costs for 2018 and where operational efficiency can be 2018 vis-a-vis '17
  -0.33  0 So it goes in the opposite direction
   0.00  1 So that number is pretty well underpinned
   0.20  0 On Macondo CSSP, I mean I can go through great detail
  -0.22  0 I think the way to hold it around business economic loss claims is we've taken a further provision this quarter
  -0.10  0 It's based on what happened in the fourth quarter, which we've been over before where all the claims that came through were 10x the average of the whole life of the facility
  -0.33  0 So take those things in the round, bell claims have gone from 147 -- 149,000 is where we started, were down to less than 600 claims now to be processed
   0.11  0 We've done our best estimate again based on all the information we have, and we've fully provided for that
  -0.12  0 But we can't give you any further certainty than that other than to say there's 600 claims of the 147,000 still left to process
  -0.12  0 We have taken a provision against what we think those 600 claims will be, so we're not completely sort of unprovided
  -0.11  0 And there is a provision across what we expect the final litigation portfolio looks like as well, and we're provided for that
   0.17  0  I think, Brian, just to remind everyone the frame, so we make it easier for you to try to model this
  -0.08  0 We always keep the Gulf of Mexico separately and we'll meet the obligations with divestments rather than the rest of the frame that we describe organically, so that you can actually see our response and specifically
   0.12  0 Remember, we define operating efficiency across 4 chokes, not just the plant, but the wells, the export system and the reservoir
  -0.20  0 Firstly, I just wondered if you'd give us an update on Australia and the Woolworths deal and any implications financial or otherwise of a delay there
   0.09  0 So I think further we go -- in Downstream IR Day, I actually gave you a sort of how much of the fuel's marketing improvement will come from there
   0.00  1 And the second being from a combination of the Teranga and [ Mersu ] and the most recent discovery, Yakaar, in Senegal, a very giant resource base
   0.00  1 The key milestone, we need to get that done in the next period of time here to maintain momentum, and there are promising signs on that, so that's good
   0.25  0    I was just going to say thanks very much, that's perfect
   0.25  0 I've got 2 for Bernard actually, please
   0.00  1 First of all, on base declines, significantly better than expectations on results there, and I think you even mentioned growth in the base of 0.6%
   0.17  0 I was hoping that you could perhaps identify the areas that had the largest contribution to the reserve adds and then also perhaps identify any of the reserve add that was just related to the price effect and the year-over-year improvement in prices
    nan  1  Very good
  -0.06  1 On base decline, it -- I think in our business, we do tend to look at the big new shiny things and, of course, small changes in the existing base business, as you point out, bring about enormous value
   0.07  0 So as the capital, in many ways, has taken away, the focus of the team to optimize what they do has been intense and simply managing the gas, managing the optimization of the fields, a fantastic example
   0.00  1 We pump 1 billion data records a day, each day, into our proprietary data lake in the cloud where people have access to that data and using the digital trend that is APEX, allowing them to optimize production
  -0.33  1 That told us that the challenge that we had was actually not a challenge, and we were able to eliminate that 2 weeks of production
   0.00  1 So growing the base, I think, is a fundamental source of value and an area that I think we continue to see momentum in the years ahead
   0.02  0 But there's also things in there like the Gulf of Mexico, where we actually added material barrels in 2017 on the back of the seismic and algorithm breakthroughs that we had with the high-performance computing center that we've talked about, where we added 1 billion barrels of [ stoip ] to the Thunder Horse and Atlantis fields, maybe 200 million barrels or so of resources at Atlantis and real proved reserves being added at Thunder Horse, purely from our ability to use that high-performance computing center to crunch an algorithm, which was proprietary and put it together with some cool seismic acquisition technology
  -0.12  0 Three questions on capital framework and then apologies, one on sort of strategic
   0.00  1 In Q4, your income went up to $2.1 billion, yet you've delivered exactly the same cash flow
   0.00  1 What exactly is sort of the drag on that cash conversion? Because it feels to me that you've had -- given you've had better Upstream, better pricing, Downstream's sort of underperformed, understanding that mix in conversion
   0.00  1 That is a huge amount of flexibility
   0.00 -1 And as the proceeds came in, in the fourth quarter, that's come back down again and gearing's come down
   0.20  0 So it's not something which very easily comes into particular focus
   0.00 -1 And as I said, net debt came down through that sort of back end of the year
   0.12  0 And we've set between now and 2021, $17 billion's the ceiling, $15 billion may not be a floor depending on where the environment is
   0.04  0 On operating cash flow, there is, of course -- and we remind you of this every year, if -- you almost need to take about $1.6 billion out of the fourth quarter and remove it from the first quarter and add it back to the fourth quarter, because those of you who don't know the history of the economic union inside Europe and what Germany did to achieve all the requests of EMU, we have a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion cash payment goes out early as mineral tax at the end of every year and then it reappears in the first 6 weeks of the next quarter
   0.00  1 And more importantly, if you look at it year-on-year, the rules of thumb would say it should increase by about $2.5 billion
   0.00  1 So I think all that says is everything you see coming through in the way the projects and in Downstream is driving underlying operating cash
  -0.25  0    Let me just touch the strategy question
   0.00  1 But if you think of Lightsource, then that potential grows organically in potential concert with Bernard's business and possibly even down the road in the Downstream businesses
  -0.25  1  The objective is that they will have economic value to the shareholders
  -0.50  0 Two questions, if I could, and both of them related
  -0.05  0  Yes, and then in terms of distribution to shareholders, I think we've been very clear, actually, right through the oil price correction as the oil prices came down for the last 3 years, that the first part is you scrip   offset, which we've now done, that's in the fourth quarter
  -0.14  0 And the second question is around the potential list of FIDs that BP expect to take in 2018
  -0.12  0 What could be those?  Bertrand, on your question around 2018 production guidance, as we said, 5% to 7% underlying growth expected this year
   0.00  1 As Brian said in his slide, reported production will be slightly higher than 2017
   0.00  1 So you will see a headline growth
   0.00  1 You'll see strong underlying growth, and I hope that, that gives you a little bit of a sense of the difference
    nan -1 And there may be more beyond that
  -0.20  0 The first, I guess, people have asked this question around the round and maybe the answer ends up being the same
  -0.11  0 But because of its very high gas exposure, and I take the point that the gas wells can generate high IRRs, but the real prize it seems to me is liquids
   0.00  1 I think that will be a good world for us to be in, and that's the direction we're heading in
  -0.08  0 But rather than saying we're going to do this or that with that extra free cash flow, it's probably too immature -- too early but the board does, with the management team, constantly talk about that future
  -0.12  0  Yes, I think Jon, much is made obviously of the Permian and the oil and the liquids, as you said
   0.12  0 But I think there is some reality also in what the returns are potentially in that business, and we will, of course, look at all of the opportunities and we do
   0.33  0 We screen all of the new opportunities there today
  -0.09  0 But I would just maybe give one small example, just to give you a sense of how you don't have to be in a liquids basin to generate enormous value
   0.11  0 In 2015, we had very little acreage in an area called the Bossier or Haynesville Shale, and we identified this opportunity called SoHa, South of Haynesville
  -0.14  1 The 2017 drilling program generated in excess of 40% rate of return at $3 Henry Hub
   0.00  1 We went from 0 to about 35,000 barrels a day of production in the space of 18 months and can see that production growing to over 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day in the next 4 or 5 years
   0.11  0 400 drilling locations identified and probably, Jon, more than half of the capital in the Lower 48 business going into that play alone because it is so lucrative
  -0.11  0 So yes, much is made of liquids, and certainly, we look at liquids, Lamar, all the time and look at those opportunities
   0.00  1 But just to give you an example how the model that when we separated the business was intended to work, which is the more independent mindset of go, capture acreage, appraise, develop quickly and create enormous value is working in South of Haynesville
  -0.06  0 They feel expensive when they come on the market, and when we can do the sorts of things that we can do, I won't give you an excess cost per acre, but I can tell you it is minuscule compared to some of the numbers that are created for other values
  -0.33  0 I've got a few questions
   0.08  0 Firstly, just on your resource base, you've got a big resource base, in fact, the world is resource abundant
  -0.06  0 So our intention is with these resources to make sure they're low-cost and they will be economic, otherwise we won't actually call them resources but, Bernard, do you want to add?  Well, I think you're absolutely right, Bob
   0.00  1 So that is be the best at what we do where we work is a key element of our strategy
   0.12  0 I think they're needed, and I think we will look at opportunities differently going forward
   0.07  0 I think, Bob, in Alaska, the fiscal changes potentially around what has been achieved with the Trump Administration around gas, which many people might have thought of this as a big stranded asset may actually come to light in terms of commerciality
  -0.20  0  It's Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets
   0.08  0 I mean, how much more attractive has it made investing into the U.S?  Maybe I'll let Bob comment on the U.S
   0.00  1 Lower 48 business generated cash for the parent in 2017 for the first time in many, many, many years
  -0.17  0 We recently accessed some very cheap liquids in the swoop area
   0.09  0 Net present value to BP is affected by this despite these short-term charges and things that everyone's trying to sort out
   0.00  1 So it's important for us
  -0.20  0 There's no doubt we'll increase investments
  -0.17  1 So from a business community standpoint, it's quite transformational
   0.20  0 There will be a lot of capital attracted to the U.S
  -0.33  0 But that's sort of 5 questions
   0.25  0 So we'll -- it depends on the time
   0.10  0 I'd like to go back to the Upstream, please, Bernard mentioning the growth platform materially ahead of schedule here
   0.00  1 But ultimately, with OpEx coming in below your target, with base decline rates better, with U.S
   0.00  1 delivering a bit more, feels like you should be maybe increasing your 2021 free cash flow estimates at this point
  -0.09  0 And then second question, sorry, was, Bob, you mentioned this last year I think, about $8 billion into solar over the last decade and not much really coming out of it so far, so we're going back into solar
   0.12  0 Maybe talk about the KPIs or the milestones you're putting in place with these joint ventures and investment opportunities to ensure there's profit coming out and you can get out in time before we end up with such large numbers again
   0.00 -1 To give you an example, the cost of a subsea well, the equipment, is down by 56% since 2012
   0.00  1 We've reduced the cost of our inspections in that equipment by 60%, simplifying an umbilical scope in Shah Deniz phase 2, reduced the cost by 42%
   0.00  1 So I think there is enormous potential
  -0.14  1 I think the savings that we've made are largely sustainable, and we're not stopping there, and we have more to do
   0.00  1 There's a lot -- many years ahead of us
   0.06  0 We'll probably give an update on the Upstream towards the end of the year, and we might provide a further update at that stage when we have more of a year under our belt, but probably too early, but I'd rather be in the position we're in today than the alternative
  -0.06  0  And on the solar point, you'll recall back in the 2000s, the company made big bets and developed over time businesses in biofuels and wind, but solar was one of them
   0.00 -1 We moved to Spain, we moved to India, we moved to China and it just -- solar cells became commoditized and panels
   0.00  1 We learned that lesson really well
  -0.04  0 So we are working where really inexpensive solar panels can be combined with project developers who develop these projects very carefully, and devs teams has been working on this where you develop -- there's a margin, you sign power contracts, you then combine that with places around the world where we're working with natural gas
  -1.00  0 My first question to Brian
  -0.14  0 My second question concerns the focus you all highlighted on modernizing BP, employing the new technologies, digitalization, predictive maintenance, et cetera
  -0.50  0 And I had 2 related questions
  -0.06  0 One is I don't have a clear picture as to whether that effort is systematically implemented through a process that aims to actually deliver that modernization across your assets over the next n years or whether it is more of a fragmented- opportunistic approach
  -0.17  0 And the second related question, from a risk management perspective, these are new technologies
   0.09  0 I mean, it will depend -- the reason why we don't do it is because, of course, as you've seen this year, the tax can move around a huge amount intra quarter
   0.00  1 But on a run year over the year, they're probably good numbers to use for now
  -0.29  0  On your technology question, it's a really interesting question
   0.00  1 What we've done is we've created pockets, maybe it sounds like it's fragmented, but people who have shown what they can do, pilot it and shown amazing results, then the uptake starts occurring all across the company, nobody wants to be left behind
   0.00  1 So, of course, we have to systematize it as we're doing Upstream and Downstream, but I think letting it spread on its own sometimes is remarkable with standards and with reliability
   0.00  1 And we learnt about 6 years ago that we'd have to have an IT frame that would enable them to still be able to do that but keep the company safe if you think about the cyber threats that sit out there and what we do around data lakes
   0.00 -1 The people we're now bringing in, the quality of these people, it's a wow to the positive and it's also wow to the wow, because it is quite extraordinary
   0.12  0 So I just wanted to hear how Pike has made it onto advantaged oil?    Actually, I'll let Bernard go first
  -0.20  0  I'd like to hear the answer to that question as well
   0.08  0 I think the first test for us, Chris, was -- and it's great that people are now asking well, why do you need the surplus cash, because 2 quarters ago, they were saying you couldn't pay the dividend
  -0.08  0 We've had extensive conversations with the board every quarter around the dividend, which we've done through this whole oil price correction and with the delivery of the 10-point plan in 2014, we'll continue to do that
  -0.67  0 So right now, there is no intent to cancel
   0.00  1 We think that's worth it given, a, our shareholders want it, and even in a benign quarter like 4Q, we had a 15% scrip uptake
   0.00  1 And I think having the financial flexibility as to how we self-set that through the year and you'll find that today we'll be back in the market buying
  -0.11  0 I know people sort of said, "Well, you stopped on a certain date in December," well, yes, because we bought back all the scrip
   0.00  1 So it'll be managed over the year and it creates some financial flexibility for the corporation
  -0.11  0 But there's been no conversation around canceling it given the feedback we get from shareholders that they like it, but they want it offset going forward
   0.00  1 So it's actually a quality resource
   0.00  1 So I think first thing I would say is that it's -- given the quality of the resource and I think the fantastic work that Devon have done, the labor costs in Canada falling dramatically over the last several years, I think it starts to enter into the competitive frame in terms of a break-even basis
  -0.20  0 So we're going to take 2 questions and then we're going to let you go
   0.07  0 I want to ask about one of my favorite projects, which is Zohr, in the sense that I do remember that when you announced the transaction, there was an option to buy more of it, which I think probably has expired
   0.10  0 And secondly, I wanted to ask about the ROACE target of more than 10% by 2021 in the spirit of slightly more transparency on tax
  -0.33  0  Oh, that is all -- okay, so that question answered itself
   0.00  1 We still think it's a really good project
   0.00  1 It was a deeper well drilled, and we just said, you know what, we've got this set of projects that we're investing in this year, it would have taken on a good healthy capital obligation from past costs as well
  -0.17  0 And so we have stepped back from it, and I'm sure Eni will have someone take that up, no question about it
  -0.25  0 Last question, sir?  It's Rob West from Redburn
  -0.08  0 I'm going to move from questions about projects on your chart to a project that is not on your chart, which I don't actually know is a real project or not
  -0.10  0 It's Kirkuk in Iraq where I've seen in the press that there's an MOU for you to double production
   0.07  0 And then just finally, really quickly on solar, I love the answer you gave about integrating it with the gas business and freeing up those molecules in Algeria to send them down the pipe to Europe
   0.00 -1 So you're right; solar costs are coming down
   0.00 -1 We have been cautious about getting involved in offshore wind because of salt in the gearboxes and working over those big turbines because -- but that technology is changing
  -1.00  0 Your other question..
   0.10 -1 Theory says there's 5 percentage points opportunity and we're unlikely to get to 100% reliability
   0.11  0 But when one door closes, you need to open another door and the door that we are opening in this space is around operating efficiency
   0.12  0 We define operating efficiency very rigorously across all 4 chokes, 95% times 4 gives you an 80% type number
   0.07  0 So we are actually focused very heavily now on driving our operating efficiency up, which obviously expands our scope, which more broadly particularly, I think, into wells and into export
  -0.08  1 So ladies and gentlemen, and let me say, again, to everyone on the line from all over the world and there's quite a few on the line, I see hundreds, in fact, thank you very much for your time

   0.00 -1 Energy Supply, significantly amplified by the Prime Minister's announcements in October that the U.K
   0.00 -1 Although we delivered over 2017 published targets in terms of operating cash flow, cost efficiency and headcount reduction, capital discipline and net debt, our financial results in the second half of the year were weak with a material miss in North America business
   0.00 -1 business Energy Supply was also poor
   0.00  1 We ended 2017 with a strong balance sheet with net debt of GBP 2.6 billion in the lower half of our end 2017 target band, and our credit metrics at levels in line with our target strong investment grade credit ratings
   0.20 -1   Despite the uncertainties we face in the U.K
   0.00  1 And to keep net debt in a band of GBP 2.25 billion to GBP 2.35 billion, designed to accommodate a range of scenarios and commodity prices and being consistent with maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings
  -0.08  0 And we expect to maintain the current level of dividend over the period 2018 to 2020, subject to meeting these operating cash flow and net debt targets
   0.25 -1 Adjusted operating profit at GBP 1.25 billion was down 17%
   0.00 -1 Earnings were down 22% to GBP 698 million, equivalent to GBP 12.6p per share
   0.00 -1 Adjusted operating cash flow was GBP 2.07 billion, EBITDA of GBP 2.14 billion was down 9%
   0.09 -1 Centrica Business saw adjusted operating profit down 67%, reflecting the very poor performance in the Energy Supply business units
   0.14  0 I've already covered our efficiency program delivery and net debt at the end of the year
  -0.10  0 Therefore, after Jeff has presented the 2017 results, I'll provide a strategic update designed to address the following questions
  -0.12  0 We know these questions are on the minds of a number of you, and it should not surprise you that I've also been reflecting on them
  -0.09  0 I will cover the customer account losses and consumer, our focus on value not volume and the relationship between customer numbers and gross margin
   0.00  1 I'll also describe how we're doing in growing gross margin through customer-facing propositions other than Energy Supply
  -0.17  0 We will cover our intentions in the outlook for both Exploration and Production and our nuclear shareholder
  -0.05  0 We'll also address the capability of we're building for the future needs of our customers and our attitude towards acquisitions and disposals before finishing on our financial framework, sources and uses of cash flow and 2018 to 2020 guidance, including the outlook for the dividend
  -0.10  0 Taken together, I hope this will help substantially in answering many of the big questions on the minds of those who follow Centrica
   0.00  1 And good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 Brent oil, NBP gas and baseload power prices were all significantly higher on average than in 2016 and remained in the band between the 70/50/50 scenario from the time of our 2015 strategy review and our 35/35/35 low case
   0.00 -1 were warmer on average compared to 2016, resulting in lower energy consumption
   0.00  1 Revenue was up 3%, which included the full year of Neas Energy revenue following its acquisition in October 2016, partially offset by the impact of lower average customer holdings compared to the prior year
   0.18 -1 As you just heard from Iain, adjusted operating profit fell by 17% to GBP 1.25 billion, reflecting significantly reduced profit in Centrica Business
   0.18 -1 Adjusted earnings also fell to GBP 698 million, including the net effect of higher interest costs and a lower effective tax rate driven by business profit mix, U.S
   0.10 -1 On cash flow, EBITDA reduced by 9% to GBP 2.14 billion, in line with the reduction in adjusted operating profit
   0.00 -1 Adjusted operating cash flow fell 23% to just over GBP 2 billion, inclusive of the one-off working capital inflow in UK Business in 2016 of GBP 357 million
   0.00 -1 Adjusting for this and for foreign exchange and commodity price movements, underlying adjusted operating cash flow fell 13% compared to 2016, and on a cumulative basis, is now broadly flat since 2015
  -0.08  0 Group net investment, which includes over GBP 800 million of disposal proceeds in the year, fell to GBP 46 million and reflecting this, net debt fell to GBP 2.6 billion
   0.00  1 Return on average capital employed was 14%, above the 10% to 12% boundary condition set out in our financial framework
  -0.10  0 A net post-tax exceptional charge of GBP 476 million was recognized in 2017, predominantly relating to impairments of E&P assets and Rough storage asset, but also including profits and losses on disposals from our divestments and restructuring costs incurred as part of our group-wide cost efficiency program
   0.25  0 Returning to adjusted operating profit
   0.08 -1 Here, you can see the split across our customer-facing divisions with Centrica Consumer profit about flat compared to 2016, but significantly down in Centrica Business
   0.12 -1 Looking now in more detail at Centrica Consumer, where operating profit fell slightly to GBP 890 million
   0.06 -1 Services operating profit declined by 4% to GBP 247 million, as strong cost efficiency delivery was not able to fully offset a 10% fall in gross margin from the lower average customer holdings and increased pension costs
   0.18 -1 Ireland operating profit was at a similar level in both sterling and euros with the impact of competitive market conditions, largely offset by cost efficiencies
   0.00 -1 Total cost per customer was down 2%
  -0.08  1 In Connected Home, gross revenue increased by 27% to GBP 42 million, reflecting growth in the volume of products sold and the diversity of customer offers
   0.12  0 Here is more detail on the drivers of year-on-year changes in adjusted operating profit in Centrica Consumer
   0.07 -1 External factors, specifically weather, foreign exchange movements and the impact of the prepayment tariff cap, reduced operating profit by around GBP 134 million
   0.17 -1 However, our efficiency program delivery of GBP 219 million largely offset these factors
   0.14 -1 Now let me turn to Centrica Business, where full year profit was down 67% to GBP 161 million
   0.08 -1 Adjusted operating cash flow fell 43%, reflecting working capital recovery in 2016 in UK Business and materially lower operating profit in North American business
   0.00 -1 Profit was down in each business unit, and I'll cover the drivers of the decline in the Energy Supply businesses, Distributed Energy & Power and Energy Marketing & Trading in the next few slides
   0.07 -1 In Central Power Generation, operating profit was down 53% to GBP 35 million, principally reflecting 2% lower generation volumes and a 4% fall in realized prices in our nuclear joint venture results
   0.10 -1 In a similar format to Centrica Consumer, here are the primary drivers of the year-on-year reduction in business operating profit
   0.00 -1 Our choices to invest in Distributed Energy & Power growth and dispose of our wind farms and CCGTs reduced operating profit by GBP 35 million
   0.00 -1 The gross margin decline reflects a 9% fall in customer accounts due to high levels of market switching, lower unit gross margins from continuing competitive intensity on acquisition and renewal pricing and the effect of high wholesale electricity cost in the first quarter of the year
   0.00 -1 In North American business, the operating profit decline was driven entirely by the fall in gross margin, slightly offset by lower operating cost
   0.09 -1 For the gas supply business, consumption was broadly flat, while warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters reduced the opportunity for wholesale optimization
   0.07 -1   In our electricity supply, we saw a 7% reduction in customer consumption, partly driven by a 3% fall in customer sites, but also the impact of increasing energy efficiency measures
   0.00 -1 In addition, unit gross margins fell by nearly 50%
   0.00 -1 As a result, total North American business gross margin fell by just over GBP 200 million year-on-year, shown in the chart on the left-hand side of the slide
   0.00 -1 Total gas gross margin declined by about GBP 40 million, reflecting the lower optimization opportunities I just mentioned
   0.12 -1 However, the biggest driver of reduced profitability in 2017 was the power supply business, shown in light blue on the chart
   0.00 -1 This reflects the lower unit margins and volumes seen on the prior slide as well as the one-off accounting charge
   0.00 -1 The North American business power supply margins were significantly lower due to a combination of factors impacting the business at the same time
   0.06 -1 Realized margins were also impacted by reductions in customer volumes as commercial customers increased their take-up of energy efficiency measures, including distributed generation
   0.00 -1 Lower customer volumes also meant that unitized, non-commodity costs were under-recovered
  -0.09  0 In response to these issues and the inherent risk exposure in power supply, we've undertaken a thorough review and investigation
  -0.05  0 As can be seen on the left-hand side of the slide, the performance of the gas business with its physical asset positions and contract flexibility has meant the gross margin delivery, even in years of extreme weather and volatility like 2014 during the polar vortex, has remained within a narrow range
   0.00 -1 The power business is more affected by extreme weather
   0.00 -1 And the knock on impact that has to electricity price spikes and ancillary charge increases, where unlike gas, we don't have the assets in positions to optimize and mitigate adverse factors in the same way
   0.00 -1 And therefore, after adding back the onetime accounting adjustment, we anticipate limited growth in underlining operating profit in North American business in 2018
   0.00  1 In Distributed Energy & Power, revenue and gross margin were both up in 2017, reflecting organic customer growth and a full year of results from ENER-G Cogen, which was acquired in May 2016
  -0.06  1 Although the segment operating loss increased to GBP 53 million, driven by planned incremental investment in growth, we are seeing good momentum on building the future order book and recurring revenue streams
  -0.05  1 We expect Distributed Energy & Power to deliver continued revenue and gross margin growth in 2018, although unlike Connected Home, we will continue to make further investment to drive this growth, and therefore, expect the current year operating loss to be similar to that in 2017
   0.12 -1   Energy Marketing & Trading reported a 35% reduction in operating profit despite continued gross margin expansion from the core route to market trading and LNG activities
   0.00  1 The capabilities we have built up over the past 3 years as well as those acquired with Neas Energy, leave us well placed to deliver ongoing growth in these areas going forward
   0.00  1 Neas, in particular, is delivering well ahead of its investment case
  -0.14  0 However, as you can see from the chart on the right, the level of gross margin from our 3 flexible legacy gas contracts, which we've been optimizing for value since demerger, declined
   0.00  1 This will be a continuing trend as the 2 most profitable of the legacy contracts end during 2018
  -0.20  0 The one remaining contract is expected to be loss-making this year based on the current commodity price inputs that make up the contract's commercial terms
   0.14 -1 This will create a year-on-year headwind for Energy Marketing & Trading operating profit in aggregate this year, and we would expect 2018 operating profit to be no more than half the level of 2017
  -0.07  0 Moving on to E&P, which, following the disposals of our Canada and Trinidad and Tobago and the formation of Spirit Energy, we'll be focused on our European gas operations
   0.18 -1 Production in Europe was down 5% as a result of our decision to undertake asset integrity works at Morecambe to help improve safety, operational efficiency and underpin the residual life of the asset
  -0.09  0 With gas from Cygnus, which came on stream last December, offsetting the impact of the natural decline in the rest of the portfolio
   0.00 -1 Adjusted operating cash flow fell 32% to GBP 448 million, reflecting higher decommissioning spend and the phasing of Norwegian tax payments between years
   0.00  1 However, E&P was still cash flow positive, even excluding the impact of disposals
   0.00 -1 Centrica Storage reported an operating profit of GBP 17 million for 2017 compared to a loss in 2016
   0.00 -1 Total reported operating costs were down 7% in 2017
   0.00  1 We also saw a continued reduction in our global functions costs as a shared service operating model became more embedded and the procurement function continued to lever -- leverage the group's scale to reduce third-party costs
   0.12  0 Iain will talk about the next phase on cost efficiency in his presentation later
  -0.04  0 As I mentioned earlier, total net investment was only GBP 46 million after taking into account GBP 819 million of disposal proceeds, predominantly relating to the sale of Lincs wind farm, Langage and Humber CCGTs as well as Canada and Trinidad and Tobago E&P assets
  -0.14  0 The disposal proceeds were a material contributor towards the net cash inflow of GBP 939 million
  -0.04  0 Cash interest payments increased in 2017 in the absence of net realized foreign exchange movements and a one-off interest benefit relating to the GLID windfarm disposal in 2016, while a higher script take-up on the first half dividend payment resulted in lower cash dividends paid
   0.00 -1 Other cash flows were down slightly with lower exceptional payments
   0.04  0 We currently expect this early repayment will result in a one-off exceptional interest charge and cash outflow of between GBP 80 million and GBP 140 million and generates annual interest savings of GBP 25 million to GBP 35 million per annum and GBP 250 million to GBP 400 million in total over the lifetime, with the range in both cases depending on the amount of debt we will purchase
   0.00 -1 As a reminder, our rating with Moody's is Baa1 with stable outlook and BBB+ with negative outlook with S&P
   0.05  0 We estimate we have achieved the target financial metrics at the end of the year, although, of course, the final calculations of the 2017 numbers are yet to be confirmed by the rating agencies, which they can consider alongside other qualitative and business risk factors in determining the overall rating
  -0.14  0 As I outlined earlier in the second part of the presentation, I'll provide a strategic update, and in so doing, also hope to address these key questions on the subjects of strategy and performance
   0.09  0 Centrica is an energy and services company and our purpose is to provide energy and services to satisfy the changing needs of our customers
   0.07  0 The reason for these changes in customer needs arises from 3 fundamental trends, which have arisen significantly as a result of a response to climate change and advances in digital technologies
   0.00  1 Second, customers have more and more choice of how they can obtain Energy Supply and the services they wish to see alongside it
   0.00  1 In response, as an energy and services company, Centrica's strategy is to deliver for the changing needs of our customers, we aim to deliver long-term shareholder value through returns and growth, be a trusted corporate citizen, an employer of choice and to become a 21st century energy and services company
   0.00  1 In 2017, unit gross margins on revenue were over 20% in both the consumer divisions and exploration and production
   0.00  1 Although much lower than this in Centrica Business overall, Distributed Energy & Power and parts of Energy Marketing & Trading also exhibited high unit gross margins
   0.00 -1 Indeed, pure Energy Supply is commoditizing and energy use per unit GDP is falling
   0.00  1 We've developed the capabilities to deliver and established clear strategic frameworks for each of consumer and business
   0.10 -1 As boilers become more intelligent and home energy management becomes more   digital with data analytics providing new insights and opportunities for the customer, we have had to develop the ability to install and maintain new home energy management systems
   0.00  1 Hive is a next phase of evolution of home energy management and a direct extension of our in-home servicing capabilities
   0.06  0 Hive Home Energy Management requires a digital hub to be installed in the home and our customers are asking for other home management applications, which can be easily served from the same hub
   0.00  1 As a result, growth and services, including Hive, is a natural extension of who we are and what we're good at
   0.00  1 Our customers want it, like it, and it reinforces and leverages the historical core offerings of the company
   0.00  1 They want more than that just commodity Energy Supply and the new capabilities and propositions we have developed, once again reinforces the core of the relationship
   0.00  1 Finally, the returns in value-added services tend to be higher than in pure commodity Energy Supply
  -0.06  0 The big message, therefore, whether in Centrica Consumer or Centrica Business is that the new propositions and services we have developed are not a distraction or somehow unrelated to our legacy businesses, they are to the heart of what our legacy businesses now have to incorporate
   0.17  0 They are to the heart of what important and valuable customer segments are demanding
   0.00  1 The good news is that Centrica has developed the capabilities to offer them in a high-quality way
  -0.17  0 As of the end of 2017, we're on track with the objectives we laid out in 2015
   0.00  1 We have created a new Exploration and Production joint venture, Spirit Energy, which will allow Centrica to participate in a stronger and more sustainable business, while limiting our exposure
   0.20  0 CCGTs and resolved the future of Centrica Storage
   0.00  1   Finally, we've maintained financial discipline, and in each of the last 3 years, we've ensured organic sources and uses of cash flow were more than balanced and with the proceeds from the divestments program, we have strengthened the balance sheet, so that net debt is now towards the bottom of our targeted end 2017 range
   0.00 -1 Without getting to this place, Centrica cannot grow cash flow
   0.07  0 We can rely upon a significant contribution from cost efficiency in the near term, but this must eventually give way to a higher proportion of cash flow growth from gross margin
   0.20  0 During 2018 to 2020, we must aim to get as close as we can to being the most efficient price setter in our chosen markets, consistent with our targeted competitive position and brand
   0.17  0 This is the basis for the next phase of our cost efficiency program of GBP 500 million per annum
   0.50 -1 Third, we must improve the effectiveness with which we operate in go-to-market
   0.12  0 I'd like to begin with cost efficiency, and will return to gross margin in a moment
   0.07  0 This slide shows the GBP 750 million per annum efficiency program delivery from 2015 to 2017 and then the additional GBP 500 million per annum target we've announced today and which will be delivered between end 2017 and end 2020
  -0.05  1 As you can see, including other cost reductions outside of the core program, our actions from 2015 have resulted in a reduction of our overall nominal controllable costs from GBP 5 billion per annum to GBP 4.5 billion while eating adverse foreign exchange impact and inflation and funding our growth
   0.00 -1 On operating cost alone, again, the nominal costs at the end of 2017 are below those of 2015
   0.00  1 We said in 2015 that by 2020, our nominal operating costs would be below those of 2015, having absorbed inflation and funded our growth, and we are on track to deliver this
   0.14  0   The new efficiency program will involve an additional cost to achieve of GBP 300 million to GBP 400 million, and I regret, it will also involve an additional direct headcount reduction of 4,000
   0.00  1 Against this, we will have created over 2,000 new jobs as we grow new propositions and businesses
   0.00  1 In consumer, although revenue has been falling gradually as has gross margin, units gross margin have been steady to rising slightly and have been over 20% in each of the last 3 years
   0.00 -1 In business, gross margin has also been falling gradually
   0.00 -1 Unit gross margins are much lower, that's about 7%, whereas, gross margin per account was around GBP 650 in 2015 and '16
   0.00 -1 In 2017, for the reasons discussed earlier, business unit gross margins fell materially because of the issues in energy supply
   0.00 -1 We will need to focus on reducing volatility of unit margins and improving consistency of returns in this area
   0.00 -1 We have seen a fall of 1.35 million accounts over 2017
  -0.25  0 and Ireland, as shown by the dark section in each bar
  -0.05  0 Of the total fall across the division, 85% or 1.17 million accounts in the yellow bar were either the result of choices we've made to end channels or not to renew collective switch populations or customer switching away but in very low-margin channels
  -0.17  0 The gross margin impact of these 1.17 million account losses was GBP 6 million, GBP 6 million
   0.00 -1 And therefore, these accounts were loss-making at the operating profit level
   0.12 -1 Given the nature of these customer segments and channels, I am convinced we could not have improved their economics
  -0.14  1 Losing these accounts was a major driver in the increase in gross margin per account I mentioned earlier
  -0.08  1 The higher-value impacts are shown by the green bars, where we've seen a net loss of 180,000 accounts, which is actually an improvement of 96,000, relative to the 12-month picture we showed to the end of June, as we saw growth in both British Gas services and Connected Home more than offsetting losses from other channels
   0.00  1 energy but we were successful in moving a net 700,000 SVT accounts onto fixed- term contracts during the year, in line with our stated objectives to encourage customers off the standard variable tariff
  -0.07  0 The total year-on-year gross margin impact within the core portfolio represented by the green bars was GBP 128 million, approximately half in energy supply and half in services
   0.25  0 It's our goal to stabilize the net position in core portfolio -- in the core portfolio and then begin to grow it
   0.00  1 And if we begin to net grow revenue from these accounts, then we will begin to be able to grow gross margin in consumer
   0.05 -1 Zooming in on UK Home and looking at the interaction between gross margin and cost efficiency, you can see that, although gross margin has been falling over the last 3 years, our cost efficiency delivery has been keeping pace with the gross margin decline, so maintaining EBIT margins per account at about GBP 39
   0.00  1 Our goal is to focus on value not volume at the gross margin level while driving costs down to underpin EBIT margins
   0.12  0 This is our focus across the consumer portfolio until we get to a position from which we can then net grow the total number of accounts
  -0.06  1 The ability to maintain competitive pricing, healthy unit gross margin quality and drive cost efficiency is crucial in the face of the potential default tariff cap in the U.K
   0.00 -1 Let me, therefore, turn to this major external uncertainty and how we plan to deal with it
  -0.11  0 government published a draft bill on a proposed temporary default tariff cap in October
  -0.11  0 And this draft bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in front of the base select committee
   0.17  0 Irrespective of whether a cap comes into effect or not, we will continue to push for all 14 points, including those which we encourage the government and Ofgem to implement
  -0.14  0 By March 31, we will withdraw the standard variable tariff for new customers, introduce a new default tariff and measures to make it harder to end up on a default tariff
  -0.11  0 In the meantime, we will continue to press the government and regulator on wider market reform
   0.20  0 To understand this, you need to look at our exposure, our competitive position, and the result of our own cost efficiency plans
   0.11  0 We are expecting to have reduced this to about 3 million by the end of 2018, as the measures I described a moment ago take effect
   0.08 -1 Secondly, as a result of our own cost efficiencies to date, our current SVT is cheaper than 85% of the SVTs in the market and is GBP 41 below the average of large supplier SVTs
   0.12  0 As a result, if we were to maintain this competitive position, any price cap will impact the majority of the market first before it impacts us
   0.12  0 The impacts on those with the highest of all SVT prices, including some of the smallest suppliers, will be even more significant
  -0.08  1 When we introduce our new default tariff to replace the SVT, which will happen by the 31st of March, we intend to continue to make it competitive relative to the market
   0.09 -1 Clearly, depending on the level of the cap initially, it's possible that the reduction in gross margin from the cap may happen more quickly than our cost efficiency can keep up, in which case, relative to our plans, we could see some EBIT margin compression, particularly in 2019
   0.21  0 However, we must remember that the government has also said that when setting a cap, Ofgem must have regard to incentivizing efficiency, enabling effective competition, maintaining incentives to switch and that efficient operators are able to finance their activities
  -0.50  0 The intent is clear
   0.00  1 with healthy returns under most conceivable scenarios
  -0.08  0 Staying with the U.K., I've included once again this breakdown of British Gas dual fuel bills with the data for 2017 added
   0.09  0 Our profit margin after tax was GBP 59 on an average dual fuel bill, once again in the range of GBP 42 to GBP 65, which has been the case since 2009
   0.00  1 In North America Home, we've been growing protection plans, as we learn from the U.K
   0.00  1 experience and have seen 18% growth year-on-year
  -0.10  1 As you can see from the graph, this on-demand offer continues to accelerate and complements our own contract relationships through British Gas
   0.00  1 In British Gas, on a half year basis, we've seen the number of accounts in in-home services grow in the second half of 2017 for the first time since 2011
   0.00  1 These growing propositions demonstrate that consumers want additional services beyond commodity energy
   0.00  1 You can see the momentum we've started to build
   0.00  1 We have seen installed hubs grow by 71% during 2017 to 900,000
  -0.12  0 As of last week, we were at 950,000 hubs, and therefore, are likely to hit our 1 million hub target very shortly, albeit 1 quarter late
   0.00  1 We did exceed our target for 1.5 million products sold, delivering a cumulative 1.63 million by the end of 2017, and we now stand at 1.8 million as of last week
   0.00  1 Connected Home continues to grow in all of our geographies, and our first international partnership with Eni in Italy will see its full commercial launch in April
   0.00  1 And in 2018, we are now targeting a doubling of revenue, 500,000 new customers and over 1 million incremental product sales
   0.00  1 As you can see in terms of smart thermostats, we now rank fourth globally and are the market leader in the U.K
   0.00 -1 Let me now turn to the business division and the area in which our performance let us down in the second half of 2017, North America business
   0.00  1 Our recent track record is generally a good one, particularly in natural gas supply and optimization
   0.00 -1 The issues we had in the second half of 2017 predominantly relates to the power supply book
   0.00 -1 However, as Jeff covered earlier, changes in the market, including backwardated capacity curves, combined with unsophisticated legacy power products, further reduced realized margins in 2017
   0.00 -1 The visibility of the degradation of performance and forecasting quality were simultaneously impacted by a new IT system under installation, which ironically is designed to give greater granularity on elements of power gross margin
  -0.27  0 Faced with this, it was imperative to investigate comprehensively what went wrong and why, and we made changes to ensure we manage the book differently going forward
  -0.33  0 Adjusting for the accounting error, it would have been 6%
  -0.11  1 The recent volatility in results is a concern, but returns have been generally attractive and the business has the potential to grow
   0.00  1 And the customer base and the capability we have give us the ability to offer new propositions and services, which will add gross margin and stickiness to customer relationships
   0.00  1 And we have the potential to grow the customer base
   0.00  1 We have built good momentum in this business
   0.00  1 Active customer sites increased by 22% over 2017
  -0.22  1 Gross revenue increased by 6% and by 34% on an underlying basis when reflecting disposals and discontinued activities
   0.00  1 We also saw a 26% increase in order book revenue with accelerated growth over the fourth quarter
   0.00  1 We have transformed the way we go-to-market, including increased sales capacity, development of new propositions and bringing our products together under one brand, Centrica Business Solutions
   0.00  1 In 2018, we are targeting revenue growth of at least 50%
   0.12  0 We would also be prepared to reduce our shareholding in Spirit Energy to below 50% if the right opportunity came along
   0.00  1 Ultimately, the formation of the new business has created optionality for both shareholders and, as we said at the time of the announcement, we also do not rule out the possibility of an IPO in the medium term
  -0.08  1 We will look to create synergies between Centrica Storage and Spirit while continuing to explore the commercial optionality of the Easington terminal
  -0.10  0 Before moving onto our financial framework and outlook for 2018 to '20, let me cover how we're thinking about acquisitions and disposals over the period
   0.00 -1 This is because of the uncertainty over the U.K
  -0.08  0 We may, however, make small bolt-on acquisitions to build our customer-facing capability within the capital reinvestment limits of our financial framework
  -0.14  0 Subject to ensuring alignment with our partner and being very mindful of U.K government sensitivities in this area, we would hope to divest of our shareholding in U.K
   0.00 -1 In the near term, the uncertainty around the company has increased largely because of U.K
   0.00  1 As a result of this and as we mitigate the performance issues in North America, our focus remains on performance delivery and financial discipline
   0.00  1 And we will maintain capital discipline and a strong balance sheet and we will not pursue major growth M&A
   0.25  0 As a result, we have yet to restart a progressive dividend
   0.00  1 However, we have delivered on our cost and capital discipline, and ROCE is currently running well above threshold levels
   0.00  1 Our financial framework remains valid over the medium term
   0.00 -1 While we believe this is probably also deliverable in each discrete year, taking into account the unknown formulation of a potential price cap, there remains a slight risk to being outside this range in 2019
  -0.07  0 Capital expenditure, including the consolidated total for Spirit Energy and any bolt-on acquisitions, will be limited to GBP 1.2 billion per annum, and we would expect the outcome to be in the GBP 1 billion to GBP 1.2 billion in any year
  -0.04  1 In terms of the dividend, we expect to maintain the current dividend level out to 2020 subject to 2 conditions: firstly, being able to generate adjusted operating cash flow on average within the targeted range; and secondly, to manage net debt to within the range of GBP 2.25 billion to GBP 3.25 billion
   0.00  1 Our range designed to take into account a number of scenarios, commodity price projections and consistent with maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings
   0.00 -1 But clearly, there are always risks associated with extreme commodity price movements and extreme regulatory interventions
   0.11  0 Finally, in line with the group financial framework, we would intend to restore progressive dividend
   0.00  1 In addition to the criteria already mentioned, underlying cash flow growth capability is demonstrated
  -0.33  0 This is obviously before any disposal proceeds
  -0.18  0 All of these targets assume normal weather patterns, current forward commodity price curves, and the absence of major operational outages
   0.00  1 We are absolutely committed to restore shareholder value and to demonstrate how this strategy will deliver this over the medium term
   0.00  1 I hope today, we've succeeded in addressing the important questions raised by 2017
   0.00  1 Centrica has a clear strategy as we reposition the company back towards the core of Energy Supply & Services
   0.00  1 Phase 1 of the repositioning of the company has been completed with many important milestones set -- met
   0.00  1 It is this combination and our track record of efficiency and financial discipline to date which gives us confidence to deal with the uncertainties posed by any default tariff cap in the U.K
   0.00 -1 It is undeniable that at this moment, Centrica faces a higher level of external uncertainty
  -0.12  1 It's, therefore, imperative that we focus on the things we can control to underpin our performance and that is what we're doing
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.12  0 Mark Hodges and Mark Hanafin will now join Jeff and me on the stage, and we look forward to taking your questions
  -0.25  0 As ever, our Chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, is also in the audience, should you have any questions for the board
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.11  0 As usual, if you can indicate your name and affiliation and keep the questions reasonably brief and we'll head around the room
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -1.00  0 I have 2 questions
   0.00  1 I think it was extremely helpful this morning
  -0.25  0 And as such, my first question is on the British Gas business
  -0.07  0 Can you tell us what the average margin per account is when you exclude default tariff customers because I think that will be a helpful indicator of sort of where the business might be post-tariff cap
  -0.25  0 The second question is more about overall results, where you landed for '17, and what we should expect for '18
   0.08 -1 My read is that you ended up seeing a bang on consensus for 2017 but with EBIT a little bit lower than expected, plus some positives that you mentioned in the tax line
   0.00  1  Thanks
  -0.20  0 It doesn't matter how much we disclose, there's always more
  -0.08  0 In terms of the -- and when you say default tariff inside British Gas, we don't typically disclose the gross margin or the EBIT profit
   0.12  0 But obviously, overall competitiveness will end up determining the overall level of profitability from the book
   0.00  1 And that's a book that we pointed to in H2 of 2017 that we finally started to see some growth
   0.12 -1 In terms of 2017 and the EBIT, Sam, there were a handful of things that we saw post the trading update in December that affected the full year profitability
   0.00 -1 We saw in the E&P business the [indiscernible] pipeline issues, which backed in some of our production
   0.50  0 That issue is now have been resolved
   0.20  0 We don't expect the effective tax rate to be that high
   0.17  0 A couple of questions on the new efficiency savings, please
  -0.08  0 When will they roll off? And to what extent would higher input costs impact on margins this year without a tariff rise?  Wow, quite a lot in there, Fraser
   0.25  0 So first of all, the new efficiency program generally, as of any efficiency program, we got to be extremely careful
   0.00 -1 So it wasn't like all of it was down to our own change issues, but it was a factor
   0.00  1 We've seen complaints, if I take UK Home energy as an example, improve between 20% and 30% on average each year
   0.00 -1 We've ended up, I think, 50% down on end 2014 levels -- or up rather
   0.00  1 Down on complaints, but better
   0.00 -1 But is there always risk? There is always risk associated with change
  -0.07  0 The second bit I'd like to answer just on this are you saying your base cases, no erosion to EBIT margins associated within unknown tariff capital
   0.00 -1 I indicated in my remarks that we have incorporated an impact of a tariff cap and that would imply we do see some EBIT margin impacts from a tariff cap
   0.09 -1 And I especially highlighted the issue of, while we are driving costs down, if they get out of sync with the gross margin impact of the tariff cap -- and again, we don't know what the formula is -- then, of course, we would see an impression on our EBIT   margins until our cost efficiency program caught up
  -0.14  0 And I don't know yet, but my assertion is that must be a factor along with all those other things that Ofgem have somehow got to balance
  -0.17  0 I think part of the question was, is there some kind of big event where a whole bunch of hedges roll off
   0.00 -1 That's not a risk particularly
   0.00  1 So we've been working very hard on that
  -0.20  0 And I just would go back and stress -- I know Iain mentioned it on the change
  -0.05  1 It is something I'm very, very conscious of is the amount of change we're going through in the business, but just to go back to that complaints statistics, that's 1 million complaints less over the last 3 years in UK Home Energy, whilst going through cost reductions, whilst going through the headcount reductions, whilst improving service more broadly
  -0.25  0 2 questions firstly on the British Energy state
   0.00 -1 And also what you would potentially do with the proceeds because the amounts of net debt that you're running is actually fairly low relative to the underlying cash flows for the business
  -0.33  0 My second question is on Hive
   0.00  1 But the revenues only went up by 30%
  -0.33  0 Seriously, first, on nuclear
  -0.12  1 Obviously, let's get there first, but we have to recognize, as you say, first of all that the balance sheet is quite strong
   0.08  0 And I hope I have indicated, and happy to work that with you a bit more, the source and uses of cash ought to be reasonably balanced over this period, but we do have a number of other things that we have to take into account
   0.05  0 We're going to have to spend the money on the debt repurchase program, we got to spend money on the cost to achieve, we've got other obligations like our pensioners that we've got to think about as well as wondering about ranges -- reasonable ranges of commodity prices
   0.00  1 The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of this company is now in pretty good shape
  -0.12  0 Obviously, the identity of a buyer is a very critical consideration in any sale, but the sensitivity is not really about competence
   0.00 -1 The issue is more around the acceptability of a new buyer to our partners and also to the government
   0.00  1  Yes, so as you said, Mark, 71% increase in install base, 27% increase in revenue year-on-year
   0.00 -1 I think 4 reasons for the disconnect
   0.00 -1 So the channel mix has an impact
   0.00  1 in 2017 for further growth in 2018
  -0.20  0 So a hub with some lights or some plugs as opposed to the thermostat as the first purchase
   0.14  0 What that puts us in a position to need to do next is to be obviously cross-sell and upsell to the existing base
  -0.11  0 You've got -- you made some -- you've announced the sale today your intention to get out of British Energy
   0.00 -1 The capital reinvestment intensity should go down and indeed, is going down
   0.00  1 And   we believe the right levels of resource in order to grow the company at an appropriate rate
   0.00 -1 We haven't yet demonstrated the model can grow
  -0.14  1 A positive interpretation of that is that must require a number of sources of new cash flow to overcome some of the decline
   0.00  1 And I believe that we can demonstrate that the company strategy will both pay for all of our obligations and be able to maintain the current dividend level, obviously, within bounds that we've laid out
   0.00 -1 In the current environment, given the uncertainty and given the desire to maintain a strong balance sheet, we don't or are not pursuing major M&A
   0.25  0 And really, there is nothing that attractive out there that we should be pursuing right now
  -0.20  0 So the simple answer to your question, no I don't think it does
  -1.00  0 I have 3 questions
  -0.20  0 And the second question is the transition of the SVT customers to fixed tariff during '18
  -0.10  0 And the E&P industry has a habit of costs following price, industry costs following price with a delay of about 18 months to 2.5 years
  -0.50  0 So the increase is exaggerated in 2017
   0.00 -1 There are some inflationary pressures coming through in the industry, but not dramatically as yet
   0.00 -1 If prices stay high, I would expect inflationary pressures to continue
  -0.12  0 On the weather impact in 2017, Jeff, we don't disclose the weather impact as a separate item typically
   0.08  0 I mean, we can say that across the whole company, depending on the metric or whether it's pre- or post-tax, GBP 100 million to GBP 200 million, I think was the overall impact
   0.05  0 There are differences between groups of customers depending on a number of different factors that we need to assess, whether that be their propensity to churn, their propensity to buy another product, their consumption, their debt profiling, the amount of calls we take from them
   0.17  0 Lots of this can be done digitally; lots of this can be done with the great people that we already have
   0.17  0 And so any small increase will be more than offset by the efficiency targets we've set
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.50  0 Couple of questions
   0.14  0 And effectively, we're buying back and arbitraging our sort of credit spread against that
  -0.04  0 From our perspective, if we can start moving people from SVT, which is why we are closing it to new customers and why we're engaging our whole customer base to try and move them onto an alternative product, that means we've engaged with them, that means they made an active choice, that means that they don't come under the remit of either the default tariff cap or these kinds of interventions that may or may not happen from Ofgem
   0.00  1 That's another good example of why engaging our customer base directly and moving them onto products that they are actively choosing is the right thing to do
   0.33 -1 I don't know how successful that will be
  -1.00  0 2 questions as well
   0.00 -1 And also within there, you've seen a fall in the margin, the gross margin about 10%
  -0.14  0 So other than pensions, is that a change in the market again on something we should be worried about?  So look, on the dividend
  -0.13  1 Clearly, what we have said is that we expect, which is quite a strong word, that subject to the cash flow generation and staying in the net debt range, that we would expect their dividend to remain at the current level
   0.00  1 But I am -- from my perspective, I expect that's something we're able to do
   0.11 -1 And then, on margins and profitability, you did highlight the single biggest factor, which is that gross margin's down
   0.09  0 There   are other things that we can do, whether still working on the efficiency and services well more broadly, productivity, but the biggest impact on margin was pensions
  -0.12  0 Just first of all a follow-on from Deepa's question on the transition from SVT to fixed
  -0.40  0 Your liquid sell price rose around 7% in 2017 as European Liquids, but spot prices were up sort up considerably more than that, 25% to 30%
  -0.20  0 And just lastly, on smart meters, more of a top-down question
  -0.05  0 Are you concerned at the rate of the smart meter rollout industry-wide because Ofgem and [ Bays ] do seem to be putting some emphasis on the smart meters being rolled out to contribute to getting rid of the cap in the future?  On smart meters, Mark Hodges will answer that
  -0.14  0 On the liquids realizations in E&P, I'll leave that to Jeff
  -0.10  0 Just on the SVT to fixed, and Mark Hodges can add anything to this, I mean, clearly the tariff cap is currently directed to default tariffs
  -0.20  0 Because there's a sense if you defaulted, you're not engaged
  -0.17  0 So right now, the default tariff cap is not applicable to nondefault prices
  -0.08  0 And we, therefore, believe we have freedom to offer energy as a component in a bundle or in other formulations other than on a default basis, at different prices to the cap
  -0.05  0 But until we understand the specific formulation of a cap and the calculation and how long it's going to last -- currently the legislation that's being proposed until 2020 with a possible extension to 2023 -- it's difficult to understand where all the different offerings are going to be relative to that, but we're very conscious of it
  -0.11  0 We obviously want to try from our perspective to minimize the number of people who end up on the default tariff
  -0.12  0 To answer your question bluntly, I don't think we can give a guarantee about where other fixed deals will be priced going forward
   0.25  0 It will depend on the nature of the product
   0.00  1 On smart meters, yes, just to reiterate, again, we are supportive of the whole smart meter rollout
   0.00  1 We think is good for consumers
   0.00 -1 We see a reduction in consumption amongst the customers who have smart meters
   0.50 -1 This is an opportune scheme
  -0.25  0 We can't force people to take a smart meter
   0.00 -1 We can resolve eventually the technology issue, it's frustrating that the DCC has gone back, again, to October, but we continue to play very active role in trying to make sure that works, and that happens
   0.20  0 I don't think there's an easy   answer to that
  -0.11  0 Probably only the Rough volumes don't quite follow that because I mean, just switched to producing asset
  -0.25  0 Fraser's got a final question
   1.00  0 So Dominic first, please
  -0.17  0 Couple of very quick questions then on your cash flow numbers, your GBP 2.1 billion to GBP 2.3 billion out to 2020
   0.05  0 And just briefly, the flex around capital and cash flow depending on the exact scenario in each year, recognizing we've got working capital movements from time-to-time that affect adjusted operating cash flow
   0.00  1 I mean, that's a reason for the slightly expanded and net debt range
   0.00 -1 The dollar fell about 10% in the past year
   0.09  0 And are you expecting to bridge the gap going forward as you roll in new markets?  Foreign exchange, Jeff and then Mark on our competitive position and Connected Home
   0.12  0 Obviously, the impact is most easily seen in the financial statements is around in the North American operations if it's against the dollar
   0.40  0 And you can fairly easily do that with reported operating profit by and large
   0.10  0 I think the piece that is harder to frankly estimate at any particular point in time because it's involved with the E&P cost base is that, particularly in Norway, a lot of the costs are effectively because of the knock effectively in underlying US dollars
  -0.07  1 So we do get this play of an impact on the cost base, which even if the pound is weakening is helping us from a revenue perspective, but is then offset from an underlying cost perspective
   0.00 -1 They're much harder to estimate
   0.00  1 Our stronghold is the U.K
   0.00  1 Hence the D&I deal, I think, from our perspective, really interesting
   0.00  1 We have another very large energy supplier who wants to be in the Connected Home space who doesn't want to start from scratch, who has a field force, who can do the read across to what we've done and think that we are a great partner because we understand their business, and we can help them
   1.00  0 more easily in Europe
   0.00 -1 In the U.S., we're going to have to really prove ourselves from scratch
   0.00 -1 The penetration at the moment is still reasonably low
   0.00  1 And so I think we can find our own way competitively
  -0.12  0 Firstly, quickly just on EM&T, you talked about the legacy contracts rolling off
  -0.07  0 And I guess given the run rate moving from standard variable to another type of default tariff, it sounds like it could even get to 0 standard variable tariff by 2020
   0.25  0 Now some of the things we are proposing they do aren't easy, politically aren't easy
  -0.12  0 And on your timing question, we're going to withdraw the standard tariff for new customers by the 31st of March
  -0.12  0 We tend to find the governments don't act when the politics or the situation is difficult
   0.00  1  So on the core EM&T business, we do see continued growth in that business
   0.00  1 We have a very good capability there so we see growth around route-to-market origination, LNG and gas and power trading
  -0.33  0 The legacy contracts, there are 3 of them left
   0.25  0 We've got 2 profitable rolling off next year -- this year, sorry
  -0.50  0 And then, we are left for a number of years with a loss- making contract
  -0.07  0 And therefore, the loss position on that remaining contract really depends on that basket of indices, which are some quite strange energy indices in there versus the gas price that we can sell at
   0.10  0 To give you an indication of it, Jeff referred to some guidance around operating profit being about half this year versus last year in EM&T
  -0.40  0 I would say that most of that delta is related to that loss- making contract
   0.00  1    Thank you
  -0.33  0 So we're exposed to that spread
  -0.17  0 However, since we signed the contract a number of years ago, we've been building up our LNG capability
  -0.05  1 And some commentators, notably Shell, pointing to that and saying, "Look, it's quite difficult to predict what demand is and maybe that glut isn't there." We're still assuming it is but others are being more positive in terms of their outlook on supply demand
  -0.09  0 Just if I might circle back to Iain's question about asset shedding, and mindful of the block of sale of CCGTs earlier this year or the last year rather, including Langage
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00 -1 The first thing is that   our performance was weak last year, but I hope that to a degree you can now look through that with some confidence
   0.00 -1 The second thing is the largest impact on our shareholder experience last year was actually not our performance, although it was probably the last straw, but it was actually this uncertainty around politics and regulatory intervention in the U.K, in our largest market
   0.00  1 Fourthly, given that there's a lot going on that we can't control, our focus is what we can control and it's on performance delivery and financial discipline and that is something we've demonstrated over the last 3 years
   0.00  1 The first thing are the people in this company and their capability that we've got
   0.20  0 The second are the assets and market positions that we start with from this point
   0.00  1 And so if you like, the starting point and the covenant that we can offer is a strong one
   0.00  1 And we hope that we can demonstrate our performance going forward through our actions, and we look forward to updating you with the trading update and then at the middle of the year
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

   0.50  0 Please go ahead
   0.00  1  Good morning
  -0.14  0 Following the presentation by Zoran and Michalis, we will open the floor to questions
  -0.17  0 These should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements on the screen
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Full Year Results Call
   0.00  1 2017 was an exceptional year for the company
   0.00  1 Volumes grew by 2.2% overall, with strong growth in the second half of the year
   0.00  1 We grew across all segments, with particularly strong growth in our Emerging and Developing countries, despite a challenging operating environment in both Nigeria and Russia
   0.00  1 Comparable EPS was EUR 1.23, up 27% on the prior year
   0.00  1 Finally, our board is proposing a EUR 0.54 dividend per share, a 23% increase on the 2016 dividend
   0.00  1 Hello, everyone
  -0.05  0 In line with our practice, as I take you through our financial results for the full year, I will refer to comparable figures which exclude the impact of restructuring costs, the mark-to-market valuation impact of commodity hedges and specific nonrecurring items
   0.00  1 Currency-neutral net sales revenue grew by 5.9% in the full year
   0.00  1 On a reported basis, net sales revenue increased by 4.9%
   0.00 -1 In recent years, reported revenue growth has been considerably smaller than the currency-neutral one
   0.00  1 We are pleased to see good momentum in our medium-sized and Emerging and Developing segment countries, while Nigeria and Russia produced flattish results in a challenging operating environment
   0.15  0 We also managed our input costs carefully, taking advantage of certain windows of opportunity to prebuy PET resin, for instance
  -0.09  1 Currency impact was an EUR 8 million tailwind in the year due to the strong Russian ruble, which more than offset our other weaker currencies, mainly the Nigerian naira
   0.00  1 We generated strong free cash flow of EUR 426 million in the full year, down EUR 5 million year-on-year
   0.00  1 Higher operating cash flow was offset by a EUR 46 million increase in net capital expenditure, as per our plans to invest in revenue- generating assets
   0.00  1 It is also good to see that the growth is broad based across our markets
  -0.10  1 We also implemented significant pricing to offset adverse foreign currency movements, particularly in the Emerging segment
   0.00  1 In our Established markets, currency-neutral revenue per case increased by 0.7%
   0.00  1 Category and package mix also contributed to the improvement, offsetting adverse channel mix
   0.00  1 Currency-neutral input cost per case was up by 3.1% in the year
   0.00  1 We had contracted EU sugar prices at favorable levels at the end of 2015, which proved successful
   0.00  1 In the year, this resulted in comparable operating expenses reducing to 27.9% of revenue, a 30 basis point reduction compared to the prior year
   0.08  0 Direct marketing expense increased in absolute terms to support our new product and flavor launches and was stable as a percentage of revenue
  -0.07  1 This is a result of driving price/mix and volume while managing input and operating costs, enhanced by the absence of adverse net foreign exchange movements
   0.10 -1 Historically, currency movements have been a headwind to profitability, impacting predominantly the Emerging market segment
  -0.06  1 In Developing markets, improved volume, price and mix only partly offset the impact of unfavorable input costs and higher operating expenses due to the bad debt provision in Croatia
   0.00  1 Excluding the provision, the Developing segment EBIT grew year-on-year
   0.00  1 These factors more than offset higher costs of goods sold and increased operating expenses
  -0.22  0 As far as restructuring is concerned, we incurred charges of EUR 29 million in the year, mostly in our Established and Emerging segments
   0.00  1 Restructuring benefits in the year from 2016 and 2017 initiatives amounted to EUR 17 million
   0.00 -1 We generated EUR 426 million in the year, EUR 5 million less than in the prior year
  -0.09  1 We remained disciplined in our working capital management, sustainably delivering triple-digit negative balance
   0.00  1 In 2017, we accelerated investments in revenue-generating assets to support the momentum in top line growth
   0.14  0 Before I conclude, let me walk you through our profit margin levers in the light of our 2017 results
  -0.02  1 Applying this formula to our results, our 120 basis points EBIT margin expansion in the year can be explained as follows: 50 basis points of margin expansion from volume leverage based on the 2.2% volume growth in the year, 230 basis points expansion from revenue leverage based on the 3.6% growth in currency-neutral revenue per case in the year, 10 basis points expansion from our cost productivity initiatives, 100 basis points contraction from the combined impact of currency and input costs
   0.00 -1 Somewhat unusually this year, we also have a 70 basis points headwind from one-off costs, 30 basis points in cost of sales and 40 basis points in OpEx
  -0.10  0 These include a bad debt provision and our investment into the redesign of our revenue growth management framework
   0.00  1 Overall, volume increased by 2.2%, an acceleration from the marginal expansion of 0.1% in the prior year
   0.00  1 Additionally, all 3 segments delivered faster volume growth in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half
   0.00  1 Furthermore, strong volume delivery from our markets such as Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Hungary and the Czech Republic was an important component of overall volume growth
   0.17 -1 Nigeria and Russia had tough operating conditions in the year, although their economies are forecast to improve
   0.00  1 In Established markets, volume grew by 1.1%, helped by a good summer
  -0.14  1 Water and Energy were the growth drivers, more than offsetting declines in Sparkling, Juice and ready-to-drink tea
   0.00  1 Developing markets grew volumes by 2.8%, showing an acceleration in the second half mainly due to an acceleration of volume performance in Poland
  -0.08  1 Volume growth was driven by Sparkling, Energy and Juice, partially offset by declines in Water, ready-to-drink tea and sports drinks
   0.00  1 In the Emerging markets, volume grew by 2.7%, with a strong growth in Ukraine, Romania and Serbia
   0.00  1 All categories grew in this segment, apart from ready-to-drink tea
   0.00  1 And we are seeing strong growth trends from new variants and flavor launches such as Coca-Cola Lime, Coca-Cola Zero Lemon, Sprite Cucumber, Schweppes Pomegranate and 8 new flavors of Fanta
   0.00  1 As the result of our efforts, sparkling beverages volumes increased by 2.3% in the year, faster than 1.2% growth rate we saw in 2016
   0.00  1 All our marketing in the Developing and Emerging segments delivered volume growth in Sparkling, with the exception of Nigeria
   0.00  1 Within the Sparkling category and overall for the group, Trademark Coca-Cola increased by 2.7%, with a 22% increase in Coke Zero
   0.00  1 We also saw a 5% uplift in Schweppes and 3% in Fanta
   0.00  1 We are also seeing growth overall in our still drinks portfolio
  -0.14  1 Water grew by 3% in the year, with growth in Established and Emerging segments and decline in Developing
   0.00  1 On the other hand, Juice volume is back to growth in Russia
   0.00  1 Energy continues to be a strategically important category for us, and we delivered another year of volume growth above 20%
   0.00  1 Growth is supported by Monster, which increased volumes by 48.3%, including the launch in Nigeria, and 40.6% on an organic basis
  -0.12  1 Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria, the countries where we will retain the Nestea brand, delivered   volume growth, while other countries were in decline in 2017
   0.00  1 The early indications from the markets are very good, and we believe that the new launch will revitalize the category in the coming years
   0.00  1 In our Established markets segment, volume was up by 1.1% in the year, mainly a result of Water and energy drinks
   0.00 -1 While full-sugar sparkling drinks have been under pressure for some time in Italy, our efforts in lights, adult drinks, single- serve packaging; and the hotels, restaurants and cafés channels are bearing fruit
   0.00  1 For instance, Coke Zero, which now accounts for 16% of Trademark Coke in Italy, grew by 21% in the year
   0.00  1 Volume in Greece grew by 6% in the full year, driven by Water, Sparkling and Energy
   0.00  1 The good summer, a good tourist season and an improving retail market helped, although macroeconomic conditions are still challenging
   0.00  1 Low-calorie sparkling drinks grew, with growth in Coca-Cola Zero further helped by the launch of the new Coca-Cola with stevia and no calories
  -0.05  1 Good performance in Water, growth in Coca- Cola Zero following the launch of the new 0-sugar formula and in Fanta with the slider bottle were not enough to offset declines in Coca-Cola regular and ready-to-drink tea
  -0.25  1 Favorable price and product mix more than offset the unfavorable channel mix
   0.00  1 In our Developing markets, volume grew by 2.8%, with an acceleration in the second half mainly due to acceleration of volume performance in Poland
  -0.10  1 Volume growth was driven by Sparkling, Energy and Juice, partially offset by declines in Water and ready-to-drink tea
   0.00  1 We finished the year with 1.5% volume growth in 2017
   0.00  1 In the Czech Republic, volume grew by 6%, with all categories growing except for Water
   0.00  1 Sparkling delivered high single-digit growth driven by Coca-Cola regular, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta and Sprite
   0.00 -1 Water declined by high single digits despite a flattish fourth quarter, while Energy continued to grow, driven by Monster
   0.00  1 Volumes grew by 7% overall
   0.00  1 Coca-Cola trademark grew by mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in Coca- Cola Zero following the launch of the new formula and by growth in Coca-Cola regular
   0.00  1 Fanta grew by double digits as well following the launch of the new Fanta slider bottle
   0.00  1 Water grew by high single digits, helped by the good weather in the third quarter
   0.00  1 Overall in the segment, favorable price, category and package mix resulted in a 2.7% increase in FX- neutral revenue per case
  -0.09  1 Volume in our Emerging markets grew by 2.7%, with strong growth in Ukraine, Romania and Serbia which more than offset the marginal declines in Russia and Nigeria
   0.00  1 Volume in Russia declined by 0.3% for the full year, with positive momentum through the year culminating in a good fourth quarter
   0.00  1 It is good to see that Trademark Coke was up mid-single digits, supported by Coke Zero which grew in the high teens
  -0.17  1 Juice volume returned to growth after a couple of difficult years
   0.00  1 We adjusted our PET package sizes to maintain price points   relevant to the consumer, which helped to maintain volumes
  -0.09  1 Stills grew mid-single digits, with high single-digit growth in Water but a double-digit decline in Juice
   0.00  1 Volume in Romania grew by 6%, with strong results across all categories
   0.00  1 Sparkling grew mid-single digits, with mid-single-digit growth in Trademark Coke and Fanta
   0.00  1 Schweppes grew in the low teens
   0.00  1 Stills grew high single digits, with mid-single-digit growth from Water and Juice
   0.00  1 Ready-to-drink tea continues to do well, with mid-teens expansion
   0.00  1 FX-neutral revenue per case grew by 6.9% in the period, in line with our strategy to implement pricing initiatives in markets facing inflationary pressures and currency headwinds
   0.20  0 It is pleasing to see that both category and package mix also supported value
   0.00  1 Looking at 2018, we expect volume to continue to grow in all 3 segments, with the Emerging markets segment accelerating and Russia and Nigeria return to volume growth
   0.00  1 Our revenue growth management initiatives which are designed to grow revenue faster than volume have gained momentum
   0.00 -1 With relative stability in Nigeria and Russia, the contribution from pricing actions is likely to slow down in 2018
   0.00 -1 At current commodity price levels, input costs are expected to be a low single-digit headwind in the year mainly driven by resin
   0.00 -1 Taking into account our hedge positions and current spot rates, the adverse impact on EBIT from foreign currency is expected to be around EUR 30 million for the full year
  -0.33  0 And Michalis and I will take your questions
  -0.14  0    [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjeet Aujla from Crédit Suisse in London
  -0.17  0  My first question is really on your volume growth outlook
   0.00  1 You sound pretty upbeat
   0.00  1 And for that reason, we expect volume to continue grow in all 3 segments
   0.00  1 And as you'll remember, the summer volumes were particularly strong due to very good weather
   0.00  1 Now we will work hard to repeat our 2017 volume performance in the Established segment
   0.00  1 Now in the Developing segment, we do see ongoing good economic conditions
   0.00  1 And with that background, we think that our teams can deliver an equally good year of volume growth
  -0.12  1 In the Emerging segment, where we delivered strong volume growth even though Russia and Nigeria saw marginal declines
   0.00  1 Now we think that, in 2018, we will see a better performance from Russia and Nigeria, while a few markets such as Ukraine and Romania which delivered really exceptional volume growth in 2017 may see a slight slowdown, so overall we think that volume growth in the Emerging segment has room to accelerate
   0.00  1 It is the fastest-growing billion-dollar brand from The Coca-Cola Company portfolio
   0.00  1 So with that, I remain quite confident that with the FUZE tea we will be able to reshape the iced tea category
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.14  0  My follow-up question is really on some of the investments that you've been putting through
  -0.10  1 Now in particular with revenue growth management over the last 2 years, we've been stepping up quite a bit the way we do things, increasing our capability
   0.00  1 And all of that resulted in the targeting initiatives that we have implemented last year and that we will continue this year and the years to come
   0.00  1 And one of the examples of that is our acceleration behind coolers, which we started last year but even more we will continue this year
  -1.00  0 And the next question is from Richard Felton from Morgan Stanley in London
   0.00  1  First of all, on Nigeria, you mentioned in your pre-prepared remarks that you expect it to return to volume growth in FY '18
  -0.25  1 Even in 2017, bearing in mind that we have done pricing in excess of 30%, delivering this minor decline in volume, we find that as a very good result
   0.00  1 We have to also bear in mind that we will be cycling very strong Q1 last year
   0.00 -1 And that's why we do see that start of the year will be more soft
   0.33  0 However, then progressively it is going to pick up and accelerate
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.14  1 You mentioned in your statement that, without that bad debt provision, EBIT would have been up year-on-year
   0.00  1 So yes, absolute EBIT would have been up
   0.00 -1 EBIT margin would have been marginally down
   0.00 -1 And also, we had some promo pressures which had an unusually higher impact in terms of the revenue per case and overall the margin
   0.00  1 So a small decrease if you exclude the impact of the Croatian bad debt provision, very confident that we can resume margin growth in 2018 in Developing
  -0.17  0 And we have a question from Stamatios Draziotis from Eurobank Equity Investments
  -0.14  0 Firstly, on the volume argument, just a follow-up mainly regarding Russia
  -0.33  0 Second question would be on -- sorry
  -0.29  0 Can I remind you and perhaps those who may have dialed-in late to the call that we suggest you ask your questions one at a time?  Yes
  -0.25  0  Let us answer one question before you ask another
  -0.12  0 We will make sure the operator will keep your line open until we exhaust your questions
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 So in Russia, we see that signs of economic recovery are continuing
   0.00 -1 You know what, so far, we have not seen growth in NARTD market
   0.00 -1 And the summer weather was, in particular, poor in Russia last year
   0.00 -1 Our volume, to remind you, last year was like minor 0.3 down, almost flat
   0.00  1 Now we view these properties as long-term investments rather than a pure volume booster for the year of the event because, after all, you know that the event only lasts a month
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.15  0 If you could just comment on the drivers of that, namely pricing and mix; and just if you could just focus primarily on channel mix and where you expect improvements mainly in Established and Emerging markets, please
   0.00  1  Thanks
   0.00  1 In the Developing, where we've seen a slowing down of FX-neutral NSR per case   expansion throughout 2017, and this was, as you might heard before, when we finalized our half 1 actions in Poland, this was driven by better category and package mix, also aided by our RGM initiatives
   0.00 -1 So the outlook, we do not expect this moderating trend in price/mix to continue
   0.00 -1 Lastly, in the Emerging, price/mix has moderated in the second half of '17, as we have cycled the price increase taken in Russia in Q2 of 2016
   0.00  1 Positive category mix also helped us, while package mix has deteriorated
   0.12 -1 Now in particular to the channel mix impact that you asked, we do not expect that this channel mix is going to be better in the future
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.14  0  And my last question would be on your balance sheet and your -- if I can say, your re-leveraging options
   0.20  0 It will depend also on the timing; what other opportunities on bolt-on acquisitions, as you mentioned, exist at the time
  -1.00  0 And the next question is from Edward Mundy from Jefferies in London
   0.00 -1 And looking at things historically, we have seen a significant hit from FX in the last couple of years before '17, I mean
   0.25  0 In Nigeria we have a stable situation, I would say, now with the currency
   0.10 -1 So from a transactional impact perspective, that generates probably a muted impact, whereas due to the strengthening of the euro against the dollar, the gross rate is very high
   0.00  1 We are in a good place with regard to the coverage of ruble to the dollar, around 60%
   0.20  0 We are already hedged at good rates, whereas euro to the   ruble, we are only 33%, exactly because the window has not been favorable due to the strength of the euro against the dollar
  -0.33  0 My second question is looking at Slide 14, where you give a very helpful breakdown
  -0.17  0 It does feel like you're going to be bashing through your 11% margin quite comfortably in 2018
  -0.14  0 With the exception of the bad debt provision in Croatia, all the rest are items that we expect to see also in 2018
  -0.05  1 When it comes to volume and revenue, as Zoran was saying earlier, we are looking at potentially a rebalancing with some acceleration of the volume growth compared to '17 and some potentially small slowdown in the revenue per case currency-neutral growth compared to '17 again
   0.00 -1 So that means that, because there is 1 to 3 in terms of impact, in terms of the factors and the contributions in the EBIT margin growth, overall this impact will be a little bit weaker than the positive impact we saw in 2017
   0.00  1 And if you look at the combined effect of this positive FX impact from the ruble and the fact that we slowed down dramatically the pricing that we took in Russia compared to our original plans exactly because the currency was helping quite a lot, I would say that the combined impact, without this being extremely scientific, is probably around 50 basis points
   0.00  1 So out of the 120, I will say that 50 basis points is, if you like, the exceptional performance of the ruble in 2017
   0.12  0 So that gives you a little bit of guidance as to which way we expect a normal EBIT margin progression to be in 2018
  -0.33  0 And my final question is for Zoran
   0.00  1 And you say you're very fortunate to take over a business performing well
   0.17  0 Where do you see the biggest opportunities for Coke Hellenic as we stand today?  Thank you, Ed
  -0.20  0 Well, there are a couple of things I would like to say on this question
  -0.09  0 Being part of the company for quite some time, I was also part of the team that has worked on the creation of our strategic plan
   0.00  1 And I strongly believe our strategic choices are the right ones to help us drive sustainable growth
   0.50 -1 In many, in a number of categories, we don't have a leading position
  -1.00  0 And we have a question from Fernando Ferreira from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London
   0.07  0 Now very short answer is that a big majority of our growth is actually coming from a variety of innovations that we have done last year, whether that's various reformulations, new flavor variants, whether that's new packages
   0.25  0 So all of that -- well, a big majority of our growth is driven by these innovations
   0.00  1 And that's one of the pillars in our strategy where we communicate how we drive value, so very relevant category
   0.00  1 And we only see that with this category we will be growing and driving more value in the years to come
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 I mean all of your margin expansion came from EM last year
   0.08  0 And as you saw this unusual benefit, right, from FX, do you expect a more balanced margin expansion within your regions thinking about this year?  Yes, Fernando
   0.00  1 So indeed we saw in 2017 significantly all the margin expansion coming from the Emerging
   0.00  1 So going forward, it's also normal to expect that this is the segment where we expect the lion's share of the margin expansion to come from
   0.00  1   In Established we have already reached a level of margin which is above 10%, and we have stabilized quite well there
   0.00  1 This is a good level of margin for this type of markets
   0.00 -1 Developing has a little bit more room to grow
   0.00  1 However, Emerging will continue to be the lion's share of the growth
  -0.33  0 And we have a question from Andrew Holland from Societe Generale, London
  -0.10  0 Because with the various clues you're giving us, I'm getting various, different, slightly conflicting numbers
  -0.14  0 So it would be quite helpful if you could just tell us how big that bad debt is, please
  -0.13  0 Have I got that wrong?  40 basis points was the total OpEx one-off, so investments in revenue growth management, some other items that were going on and the bad debt provision
  -0.25  0  Okay, that's clearer, although not quite there
  -0.09  1 Second question, actually arising from the last one: You say that the 10% margin you're getting in Established markets is a pretty good level
   0.00  1 So we will -- as I said earlier, we will continue to grow Established margins but not to the tune of those countries that you just mentioned
   0.33  0 I mean you say that the naira has sort of stabilized
  -0.10  0 We equally stay alert to constantly pulse the market and monitor dynamic competitively what is going on
  -0.10  0 And understanding that today we have quite some price premium versus the competition, we have certain thoughts what we want to do in the course of the year
  -0.33  0 And we have a question from [ Peter Osowitz ] from [indiscernible] in London
   0.00  1 Together with Coca-Cola Company, we are a proud sponsor of the national football team
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 And that gave us also the signs and reasons for belief that Russia is going to have a good 2018
   0.00  1 In Nigeria, realistically we have to be fair to say that, end of last year and Q1 of this year, we are cycling strong performance of last year, knowing that we are cycling that with a sizable price premium versus the market
   0.00  1 So as we were saying earlier, we are accelerating our revenue-generating assets -- investment in those revenue-generating assets and both in Russia and in Nigeria
   0.09  0 In Nigeria, we are looking not only the opportunities where we can increase capacity, particularly in PET lines, because the market is moving very quickly towards this part
  -0.11  1 And as we -- as you saw in 2017, we had a significant acceleration of the CapEx as percent of revenue, considering also that revenue is growing quite fast
   0.00  1 And we will continue with further acceleration of CapEx as percent of revenue also in '18, driven by Russia and Nigeria
   0.00  1 We had acceleration in 2017 overall from 5.3% to 5.8% in the total CapEx
   0.00 -1 I mean, should we -- because now you are about 15% below the 2014 peak in terms of volumes
   1.00  0 Or that will stabilize somewhere lower
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00 -1 Or there are some reasons for them to be lower
   0.00  1 So definitely we see that -- year by year, with current visibility that we have of Russia, it's that it is going to be continue growing and -- but it's just going to take -- it's going to be a paced growth
  -0.25  0 And just my last question was on the -- on sugar prices
   0.00 -1 2018 seems to be shaping up -- I'm talking about sugar, seems to be shaping up even lower than 2017
   0.00  1 And we have good visibility on that because we are fully covered in Russia, and we are more than 70% covered in Nigeria already
   0.00  1 So we feel quite confident about this outlook
  -0.13  1 Same with EU sugar, where the abolition of the quota regime in the European Union and also the oversupply generally in the market has helped us to lock into contracts for 2018 and 2019, to that matter, at prices that are high single-digit down compared to 2017
   0.00  1 The flip side of this is in resin, where we expect a high single-digit increase which is driven both by the higher oil price environment and also the fact that the resin market is experiencing a tight demand situation, so an increased demand situation
   0.00  1 So high single-digit increase
   0.00  1 And all this drives in total the input cost per case currency neutral for '18 to low single-digit increase
   0.50  0 Okay, perfect
  -0.25  0 Is that fair, assuming that the current spot persists
  -0.33  0 And we have a question from Tristan van Strien from Redburn
  -0.33  0 Or is there anything that will prevent you from doing that at the moment?  Thank you, Tristan
  -0.13  0 We don't see anything on our radar screen which would show the risk of any delisting or as you referred to and equally also no obstacle in activating and executing our Easter plans across all of our markets, so we are heading in fully ready
   0.00  1 Good stuff
   0.14  0 Just secondly, in Nigeria, is it safe to assume you made a profit this year?  Tristan, as you know -- this is Michalis
   0.00  1 We don't disclose profitability by market, but everything you heard, I hope, points to the fact that it was a good year in Nigeria
   0.00  1 We have also done with the expert help that has helped us through the process
   0.00  1 And as Michalis also reiterated earlier, we see that as an important investment for our future growth and how we fuel it
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.17  0 And the final question we have coming through is from Komal Dhillon from JPMorgan in London
   0.11  0 So obviously you've had a very successful OBPPC strategy that you've deployed over many years, so I'm just curious to know what exactly the difference is with this new strategy; and also from that, an idea of how much incremental improvement we can expect on mix going forward
   0.50  0 That's the first one, please
   0.20  0 Of course, part of the RGM is also pricing, for which we are ready to take it whenever there is opportunity to do it
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.33  0 And then just a second and last question from my side, on leverage
  -0.14  0 So obviously your balance sheet is quite ungeared now, 0.8x net debt-EBITDA
   0.15  0 How should we be thinking about capital deployment and then the time line of that, please?  Yes, Komal, so as we have said in the past, the position hasn't changed
  -0.09  0 Now you know we cannot do extensive buybacks because of the level of free float, so for us to optimize the balance sheet in the absence of any transformational M&A, it would be a special dividend
  -0.12  0 However, as and when the time comes, as I was saying earlier with an earlier question, we will assess where we are at that point
  -0.33  0 We have no further questions, so I'll hand you back to Mr
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.12  1 I want to thank you for joining us today and for all your questions that facilitated a good discussion, so thank you very much
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Thank you

   0.00  1                                                  Good morning, everybody
   0.09  0 I'm the Chief Executive of CRH, and I'm delighted to be here this morning with you in London to present our results for 2017, which were published here this morning
   0.00  1 We have EUR 3.3 billion of EBITDA generated in our businesses, a good year for CRH
   0.00  1 Very significant corporate activity, very active portfolio management
  -0.08  0 We disposed of a very significant business at the tail end of last year and spent over -- almost EUR 5 billion in acquiring businesses, and we'll talk a little bit about that
   0.00  1 And underpinning all of that, as you would expect from CRH, a really solid performance on cash
   0.00  1 EUR 2.2 billion of cash generated during the course of this year that left our net debt at the end of the year at a very solid 1.8x EBITDA, exactly what you would expect from CRH
   0.00  1 We believe that the 3% organic growth that you see there in our EBITDA is actually a good performance in the current environment
   0.00  1 We have a FAST Act that underpins the federal spending for infrastructure going forward
   0.00  1 It seems to be growing at about 3% per annum CAGR all the way out, supported by solid state financials, and our business showed -- delivered along those lines last year, and we expect it to deliver along those lines in 2018
   0.00  1 Residential and non-residential, again, solid growth coming forward
   0.00  1 And in Canada, a big business for us, a good solid economic performance by the Canadian economy in 2017, with GDP growth about 3% ahead of the previous year
   0.00  1 And in particular, in the residential sector, we saw residential starts up by about 10%
   0.17  0 I think it's important to realize that 2/3 of our profitability is generated in the third quarter of the year
   0.00  1 And so even besides that, the team has delivered an exceptional performance
   0.06  0 As you know, we have a pretty significant construction business in North America, and that's really the window for us into the future, really gives us a 6- to 9-month view in terms of what work will be coming forward
   0.14  0 Our group is underpinned by the residential and nonresidential building construction markets
   0.00  1 and Canada, as Albert mentioned, they remain favorable
   0.00  1 Against that backdrop, our business has performed quite well and delivered significant profit growth
   0.00  1 Laurence, which is part of our BuildingEnvelope platform, which, as the biggest acquisition ever done in the products space in CRH, continues to perform well and deliver ahead of expectations
   0.00  1 You take that portfolio change together with just a strong focus on commercial discipline and cost management, and we continue to push our business ahead with margins that, while not quite back to peak, are approaching peak levels that we achieved about a decade ago in a market environment where volumes are much lower than they were back at those peak times
  -0.17  0 Looking at our Distribution business, a business we divested early this year and had been announced late last year, maybe a couple of things to note before we move on
   0.00  1 In the final year of ownership by CRH, our Distribution business known as Allied had a very good year of trading, and we were gratified to see how it finished up with us
   0.00  1 But the momentum we saw in our markets in 2016 continued to gain pace in our major markets through 2017
   0.12  0 And there's been a lot of commentary about how activity levels have been, particularly in construction here in the United Kingdom
   0.12  0 And what we have started to see at last is the enabling work is taking place for some of the big, high- profile projects coming through
  -0.10  0 And whatever we've seen as a slowdown in commercial here in the Southeast, it has been offset by an increased spend on public infrastructure
   0.00  1 And that, combined with a fairly resilient residential market, has meant last year, in 2017, our businesses in the U.K
   0.50  0 have been broadly stable
   0.00  1 And for us, that translates into higher volumes you see on our cement business
   0.00  1 And it's good now to see pricing now following
   0.00  1 So against that backdrop, our real focus in 2017 was driving performance
   0.00  1 And even though we did have some energy input cost headwinds, with good commercial discipline, we can then see, as you see on the slide there, we could still expand our margins
   0.00  1 In Europe Lightside, we performed well across our major markets in 2017, with like-for-like sales up 4%
   0.00  1 For me, though, it was really a year of focus on performance where we drove an increase in both our margins and our returns
   0.00  1 In Europe Distribution, again strong performances across our major markets in 2017, particularly in the Netherlands and in Germany
   0.00  1 As Albert said, Switzerland remained challenging for us, but we've been very focus on cost reduction, cost control in that market, but also improving the business for the medium term
   0.00 -1 The market took a wee bit of a step back, primarily as a result of public infrastructure spending taking a step back at the first year of the new administration
  -0.17  1 Actually, the private market in residential and nonresidential was quite strong
   0.20 -1 However, against that backdrop, we really got caught in a perfect storm within the Philippines
   0.00 -1 First and foremost, we saw increased imports coming in from Southeast Asia, which impacts upon the competitive activity in the marketplace
   0.00  1 That was further heightened by the fact that with the new capacity having brought on stream in our main markets in Luzon, which again heightened competitive activity
   0.00 -1 And thirdly, we were hit with very significant cost increases in fuel cost coming up from Australia with coal coming into our businesses there, not only there but also in India
   0.12 -1 And again, against that backdrop, at a competitive environment, we were in no position to pass on those cost increases to our customers
   0.00  1 We've been working hard through the year to try and see how we can address that
   0.00  1 But whilst volumes were back a wee bit in China with the government initiatives in terms of cutting back on capacity, prices increased and sales were ahead, as were profits
   0.00 -1 And in India, whilst volumes and prices moved ahead, those cost increases I refer to impact negatively in a small, small way with regards to profitability
   0.00  1 What you can see on this slide is the growth in both sales and EBITDA over the last year
   0.00  1 Strong organic growth over the last year
   0.00  1 I think that's best reflected in operating leverage
   0.00  1 And all of our businesses in the Americas and in Europe have delivered a very strong operating leverage over the last year
   0.25  0 As you know, we make a lot of profits in dollars and also in sterling
   0.00  1 have reduced
   0.00  1 In 2017, what you can see in our earnings per share is benefits coming through in the form of deferred tax
   0.11  0 So our group effective tax rate today is currently -- the underlying rate today is at 27%
   0.00 -1 And next year, that goes down to 24% as a result of reduced tax rates in the U.S
   0.00  1 And as a result, we've generated another EUR 2.2 billion of cash from operations this year
   0.00  1 That strong conversion is a real testament of the quality of our earnings across the group
   0.00  1 Our working capital balances as a percentage of sales remain healthy
  -0.17  1 And if you recall in 2016, we talked about that metric hitting record levels
   0.14  0 So let's move on to talk about our debt position
   0.00  1 That cash from operations that I've talked about on the last slide has obviously reduced our debt
   0.08  0 And when you look at all that moving parts together, it ends up with a position where we closed out 2017 with a net debt of just under EUR 5.8 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of just under 1.8x
   0.08  0  I must say, I like this slide a lot, and we use it a lot when we talk to our own people internally about our businesses because it gives you a great sense of the story of CRH and what we do
   0.22  0 The EUR 2.2 billion of cash conversion is reflected as 70% conversion of our EBITDA, the profits we generated -- again, the cash we generated and the profits we generated within our businesses
  -0.12  0 And then I look at the portfolio working, the divestments, and both -- they're shown on both sides of the debt over there
   0.00  1 And yet having done all of that activity, we still see our balance sheet in good shape within the norms of what you'd expect from CRH
   0.00  1 The largest portion of that was, of course, in North America as we increased our footprint in cement, aggregates and concrete across the higher-growth states
   0.00  1 And you shouldn't forget, we spent over EUR 700 million on 30 deals, almost every week doing a deal, which is absolutely the bread and butter of CRH, the bolt-ons where we create value for our businesses
   0.00  1 And all of this is a constant focus on looking on where we can best allocate our capital for higher margins and higher returns and to create value for our shareholders
   0.00  1 So a very substantial business
   0.00  1 We know cement very well
   0.00  1 When we actually look at the assets that we bought with Fels, geographically, they are a very good fit for our existing lime businesses in Ireland, in Poland and in the U.K
   0.00  1 And if I look back maybe over 20-odd years to a deal we did in Poland, where we bought a minority stake in the business back then,   and it reflects on how that was really grown on mushrooms into the very strong East European platform we have today
   0.20  0 And we'll watch that space with great anticipation
  -0.08  0 Quite some time ago, we took a view that we want to strategically realign our businesses more towards the higher-growth states and regions in North America
   0.00  1 But it was clear to us with population growth and demographic shifts that actually, the southern parts of the United States have seen the largest population growth
   0.50  0 And we wanted to position ourselves there because that's where construction was going to be
   0.00  1 And the businesses that we've acquired with them are now a seamless fit with our businesses that we will think will create value for our shareholders going forward
  -0.12  0 But I think one of the things you may lose in the headline numbers is really the large aggregate business that had been acquired both in Florida through Suwannee as well as Ash Grove
   0.00  1 So a very significant aggregate business that we look to build upon through our readymixed and downstream asphalt businesses
   0.50  0 construction spend in 2017
   0.00  1 And so that's underpinned, though, through population growth in those particular areas that are twice the level of the U.S
   0.00  1 Just look at the map there and see the current CRH platform of business combined with Ash Grove and really, the overlapping and complementary markets that, that creates, expands our aggregate business in this particular market by 50%
   0.20  0 And we are now, by far and away, the largest integrated player in the Midwest
   0.00  1 And so a really solid base in terms of earnings generation for the years to come
   0.18  0 And I would just pay attention, maybe to call out 2 things in particular on this slide, really the idea behind the vertical integration benefits
  -0.10  1 But it's about that pull-through volume that's critically important in highly capitalized intensive businesses
   0.11  0 When we look at self-supply opportunities, we are the largest consumer of cement in North America and the largest consumer of aggregates
   0.17  0 And at the end of last year, we announced roughly $80 million of opportunity with Ash Grove in terms of synergies
   0.09  0 You look at the Florida business, and we talked about Suwannee Cement, but they have a substantial readymixed business, prestige as well as an aggregate company in Florida
   0.00  1 And we've identified north of $20 million of synergies with those businesses
   0.08  0 Some time ago, we took a view that it just simply was not good enough anymore to be a simple basic producer of basic materials for the construction industry
   0.12  0   And to better explain that, I want to ask 3 of my colleagues, David from a European perspective; and Keith and Randy from a U.S
   0.00  1 David? Yes, in Europe, we've delivered very significant top line growth over the last 4 years
   0.09  0 But if you look at it, we effectively bought all of that growth because with the range of transforming acquisitions that people know about, Lafarge-Holcim, now Fels, and so on
   0.00  1 But really, it's the relentless focus in performance across our businesses, across a wide range of European businesses that have delivered a significant increase in our margins
   0.00 -1 And especially, as you all know, it's especially hard in the first years after large acquisitions
   0.11  0  As we look at building a better business in Americas Products, maybe a little context setting would be useful
   0.17  0 And these 2 platforms account for about 80% of the profit generated from Americas Products division
  -0.10  0 And we -- our strategy at that time had been to build out a geographic footprint to be able to serve markets across the United States and then eventually Canada in a limited range of products
   0.17 -1 But we had to adapt our business model to the way that construction and consumer tastes were changing
   0.08  0 But to fully avail ourselves of the opportunities, we had to have a vastly different product portfolio, so through product development and product introductions as well as a strategic acquisitions
   0.04  0 In addition to concrete pavers, we now offer value-added hardscapes, masonry products, decorative lawn and garden products, and now composite decking, which allows us to have a full range of products to satisfy customer needs to execute our strategy within APG, which we call own the backyard
  -0.08  0 And similarly, looking at a similar-sized business, BuildingEnvelope, in 2007, this business was basically about cutting and shipping to small contractors what we call tempered glass, which is heat-treated glass
   0.00  1 And again, that was a nice business for us
  -0.05  0 And so through a number of acquisitions, culminated in CRL, which I spoke about earlier, was done about 2.5 years ago, we now are the only provider of the full range of products, either metal, glass or hardware to enclose the entire BuildingEnvelope so that the contract leisure, the professional who specializes in installing these products, can buy everything from CRH
   0.00  1 Now while we've had some market tailwinds over the last 4 years, if you look at how we've transformed our business, that's played a bigger role than the market in the doubling of profits that we've had in a relatively slow growth environment and the dramatic improvement that we've had in both margins and returns, which go back again are near-peak levels in a market environment which is drastically different than what we experienced back in the bubble times of 2007
   0.17  0  David and Keith gave you a couple of great examples of how they have transformed their business
   0.17  0 And you take all of those products and then deliver them through a construction services group
   0.00  1 And so as we say here, that move from rock to road has really led us to peak earnings, peak margins in an environment where volumes again are 25% below peak
   0.00 -1 In Europe, David referred to the fact that the markets didn't help us
   0.00  1 And yet, in that time, we increased our returns, almost doubled our returns
   0.00  1 And our margins have increased as well
   0.00  1 We've had growth in the U.S
   0.33 -1 But it hasn't been that fantastic
   0.00 -1 Randy's back at peak, and his volumes are 25% below the peak
   0.00  1 It's the unique business model that we have now within CRH
   0.00  1 That pace of growth that we saw in 2016 and '17 appears to be evident in the early part of 2018
   0.00  1 That's hugely a healthy sign of our business
   0.00  1 It looks to be in pretty robust shape as we go forward
   0.00  1 In Europe, the momentum in the recovery has been taking -- increasing in pace during the course of 2017
   0.00  1 Pricing is starting to pick up across our main Heavyside markets as well
   0.00  1 So we think European businesses are in good shape
  -0.14  0 So with that, I want to move on to the question-and-answer part of the presentation
  -0.20  0 Initially, we're going to take questions from the guys in the room here
  -0.11  0 I'm going to move down the wires as well and take some questions that come in down the wires as well towards the end of the morning
  -0.33  1 I myself and my colleagues will do what we can to answer your questions the best we can
  -0.50  0 I think 3 questions
  -0.14  0 And also, just looking at your appendix, it looks like quite a few prices in Europe were either flat or slightly down last year
   0.50  0 You talked about progress
   0.00  1 European momentum seems to be gathering
  -0.25  0 And then maybe a final question maybe for Randy
  -1.00  0 There are 3 questions there
   0.00  1 And with regard to the pricing in Europe last year, overall in our pricing and I presume you're talking about Heavyside cement pricing in Europe, broadly speaking, across all our markets, we saw about a 2% increase over the previous year, which given where we were coming from, actually we were quite satisfied with
   0.00 -1 Volumes have to recover first before pricing comes back
  -0.11  1 When volumes start to slowly recover, then pricing came back, and then you've seen how pricing is strong coming back to the markets
   0.00  1 And with regards to the organic growth potential that we're seeing, we think we will see in our businesses going forward
   0.00 -1 Remember, what we saw last year was significantly impacted by weather patterns in North America
   0.00 -1 And whilst -- I mean, weather at this time of the year doesn't really matter because activity levels are so low
  -0.17  0 So it's the question of last year was what was the true underlying rate, and that's an important one, which Randy will go through with that
  -0.07  0 But maybe I'll just ask Senan just to comment in terms of where you see organic growth this year?  I think if you look back to '17, as Albert mentioned, if you break it apart, the Americas organic growth was 5% for the year
   0.00  1 Our European business, on a combined basis, actually delivered a 5% organic growth as well, which was actually a good finish to the year and sets us up well going into   '18
   0.00 -1 Asia, we mentioned was down significantly last year, which brings the overall average for the group down to 3% organic growth
   0.20 -1 And then currency, obviously, is the great unknown in that equation
  -0.25  0 And of course, we have natural breaks within the system
  -0.25  0 We've got escalators within our business
  -0.14  0 Another 1/3 is actually dealt with through physical hedging, where we have terminals across North America where we buy material this time of the year
  -0.33  0 And then roughly, you got 20% to 25% that would be, I guess, exposed
   0.00  1 So for us, I think we feel very comfortable in the way we manage the energy, understand kind of the elevation in some of those costs but have mechanisms that have been proven over time to kind of be able to pass that forward
   0.14  0 So our expectation at least, as Albert said, we sell asphalt as a means to deliver profitability in our aggregate business
   0.00  1 But we feel good about margin expansion for asphalt as we look at '18
   0.00 -1 But obviously, there's a cost price dynamic, and I think you've kind of flagged that you didn't recover in asphalt in the U.S., in asphalt in the U.K
   0.00 -1 I think generally in European cement, there was a bit of a gross margin hit
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.33  0 Second question is on M&A
  -0.20  0 Obviously, with your stock trading where it is today?    Okay, 2 questions
  -0.12  0 But if I take the M&A question upfront just in terms of our thoughts on M&A for the current year and also in terms of how we look at capital allocation in the broader sense, which is really behind your question
   0.06  0 Our focus is now and will be for the next coming months is to focus on integrating that business along with the other businesses we acquired and delivering value and delivering on the synergies that Randy referred to and he can refer to within his businesses
   0.00 -1 They're not the most difficult businesses to integrate
   0.00  1 We actually know them very well for many, many years, and we've had an interesting dialogue and a good dialogue with them over the months of actually acquiring the businesses
   0.14 -1 I'd be disappointed if we didn't have good progress in integration by the half- year
   0.14  0 That with the cash we're generating now into the second half of the year, we will be back looking at further progress in the whole acquisition front as well
   0.00  1 And we have lots of opportunities, our pipeline is quite full
  -0.20  1 We are here to create value for our shareholders, full stop
   0.06  0 We actually believe looking at the opportunities we have in front of us with regards to acquisitions and internal investments, we actually believe that at this moment in time, it's best for us to focus on that
   0.14  0 Now if for an extended period of time, we saw that we were denied opportunities, we saw other opportunities to create value, we would, of course, consider that because that's the overall principle there
   0.00  1 But from our point of view, we're looking at building our business, building out the synergies and building out the footprint that delivers long-term value for our shareholders
   0.00  1 What I would say about all of that in total is that if you look at that rising input costs in the last year, we've managed to absorb that and still grow our margins in all of our divisions with the exception of the Philippines, which is obviously something we mentioned earlier
   0.09  0 You showed an interesting slide there, Albert, in terms of repositioning the business in several places Europe, OBE and that kind of integration value add
   0.07  0 Or what are the divisions, markets or regions where you can do the same, you can kind of build out that integrated platform over a period of time and contributed that kind of growth in the RONA you've delivered
  -0.12  0 I'll let Randy deal at the end with the question with regard to pricing dynamics in those markets that you referred to
  -0.08  0 I think with the model that we've set out, it's been enacted, it's been working within CRH for quite some time as my colleagues talked about
   0.14  0 The great thing about that is it's focused on the end-use markets
   0.14  0 And we focus very much on how we service the customer, how we interact with the customer to make that whole idea of [ constantly ] working with us as simple and as easy for him and for us to make the most profit in doing that
   0.08  0 The great thing about it actually it's a simple concept that's replicable across a whole range of businesses, but you have to have A, some knowledge in the Downstream concept and also a capability to work those concepts in the marketplace
   0.50  0 This is way beyond a vertical integration
   0.11  0 What we did have was we had a paving business, which was largely a commodity business, which actually was just vertically integrated with our cement business
   0.40  0 But actually, when you look at the way construction is going and look in this fine city here, how construction has changed over the last 10 years
  -0.17  0 Maybe on pricing, Randy, you might have something?  Yes, I think your question was around what have the conversations been like
   0.12  0 And so what I think as I indicated both in Ash Grove and Suwannee, where the opportunity rest is really on the logistical side
   0.00 -1 Logistics is an expensive part of the cement product itself
   0.33  0 But we would look at opportunities obviously because of supply and procurement opportunities
  -0.08  0  It's not the question you asked, but it's an interesting point, which develops in the point that Paul asked earlier on about European cement pricing
   0.00  1 Volumes have to come back first, and Europe will start to see that momentum come through, in the U.S
   1.00  0 Two if I could, please
  -0.06  0 Could you just give us a bit of a run-through about how that might be differing particularly with reference to the Northeast where there's some talk of that being a slightly slower market?  Okay, I'm actually going to ask both of our U.S
  -0.20  0 And obviously, Randy's exposed to res and infrastructure
   0.00 -1 First, it was a rainy spring, and then we had hurricanes came through which, obviously, tend to impact the south more than the other regions of the country
   0.00 -1 What we have seen is the beginnings of a little bit of recovery, a firmer recovery in the Midwest
  -0.14  1 So we, in the products business, we have and in distribution, which has since been divested, have a pretty strong presence in those areas
   0.00  1 So I'd kind of call it not nearly as robust a growth but growth in those parts of the country
   0.00  1 Some states have good financing
   0.00 -1 Some states don't have good financing, and we've kind of been hit or miss, I'd say, in the Northeast
   0.00  1 But just like the infrastructure in the Northeast, the building stock, the built environment in the Northeast and the Midwest is robust
   0.25  0 And therefore, it moves into a phase of repair and improvements
   0.00  1 That underpins a lot of our business there, which is the revitalization of the building stock there in those parts of the country
   0.00  1 Those have been and I think will continue to be solid growth markets for us
   0.00  1 So I would say higher performance in those states I just called out
   0.17  0 And what's nice about those positions is that just the total population of those areas
   0.00  1 While maybe certainly not growing as fast as some of the southern states, are very consistent
   0.14  0 So they will continue to need to reinforce the current infrastructure, expand as well as improve
   0.00  1 And so we see those as being very, very steady markets, and pricing will move along as well
   0.12  0 So as we look into '18, I think we've called out kind of in that kind of 3% to 5% range as well in terms of pricing dependent upon what region you are
  -0.11  0 We have over 900 people dialed in and watching this, and I've got a ton of questions they need to ask on the line as well
  -0.20  0 So I'm going to take maybe 1 or 2 questions from the room
  -0.17  0 My first question is can you talk us through the buckets, the main buckets of U.S
   0.00  1 The second question is regarding operating efficiencies, which have been very good in 2017 in the Heavyside businesses on both sides of the Atlantic
   0.08  0 Just on an overall comment on operating efficiencies, what I would say about that is we -- one of the slides we spoke today about the importance of performance
   0.00  1 But it has been behind the increase in the margins that they have seen in their businesses
   0.00  1 There is no silver bullet but it goes on and on every   day, and it's what you would expect from somebody like CRH because we do stand on our toes in terms of say we are good performers in what we do
  -0.25  0 What has been interesting is that over the last 3 years, and I'll get the numbers wrong by 1 or 2 here
   0.14  0 Whether it's maintenance on their vehicle, whether it's just time in their lives they regain
   0.00  1 So there is momentum there
  -0.11  0  And take one more question from the room, please, because I've got I say a lot of questions
  -0.25  0 One question is really sort of in 2 parts
   0.00  1 What we're doing in phase 1 in the Philippines is really debottlenecking our plants in Luzon and Metro Manila, where we're the market leader
   0.00  1 By doing that, these are all very strong returning projects
  -0.20  0 What that does, it displaces very expensive import, clinker, which is what we do at the moment
  -0.10  0 That probably adds about 700,000, 750,000 tonnes of locally sourced and produced clinker that will displace expensive imports
  -0.25  0 I'm going to move down the wires now because we have a lot of questions, and I have to say half the questions that are here
  -0.10  0 Just a question -- just maybe just update us in terms of volume and price trends in the Eastern European markets, which are very important for us and our European businesses
   0.00  1 Markets are growing
   0.00  1 Every one of those we expect volumes to increase by varying degrees and so good pricing
   0.00  1 Very good country, good market structure
   0.00  1 I think we have very fine business and something we can build a typical CRH model going forward
   0.00  1  Okay, good
  -1.00  0 Keith, just a question
  -0.20  0 Your own thoughts, you're very exposed to residential and nonresidential
  -0.12  0 I think someone said about business cycles, they don't die of old age, they die of imbalance
  -0.25  0 You mentioned, Albert, 30 million people every 10 years that requires quite a bit of housing
   0.00 -1 And we went way down, and we're on our way back up, but I still think that the U.S
  -0.12  0 And so I don't think it's a question of have we reached peak levels, which I don't think we have
   0.00 -1 And given the fact that we are getting near full employment in the United States
   0.00  1 And indeed, it's improving in Canada as well that I think what we'll see is continued slow growth in those markets
  -0.33  0 And question really, I suppose, for you, David
  -0.29  0 I see a lot of commentary in the local press about the potential disposal of DIY in the Netherlands
   0.00  1 And I think what we have in distribution generally I think is we have very fine business in the Netherlands itself anyway in builders merchants
  -0.33  1 This has grown quite well over the last couple of years
  -1.00  1 It did very well through the recession
   0.00  1 So we've got room for growth, I think, in general
   0.00  1 And I think what comes in and out I think as part of our normal daily business here, where we can create value for the shareholder
  -0.10  0  And just on distribution theme, we sold our Allied Distribution business in North America last year and a question really, I guess, for you, Keith, I suppose to some extent
  -0.33  0 I suppose it's a North American question
   0.00  1 So it really doesn't move the balance there much at all, which is good because we like the balance that we have
   0.00  1 And so it has shifted in very small terms our business toward the South and to the West, which I think is probably overall a good thing in terms of the growth rate that we see going forward
  -0.25  0 But I'm going to squeeze in one more question, Senan
  -0.33  0 Just a question on dividend
   0.12  0 And what's your view on dividend cover going forward, please?  Sure, yes
   0.00  1 So obviously, recognizing dividend is very important to our shareholders
  -0.10  0 We closed out 2017 with a dividend cover of 2.4x if I take out 2 exceptional items that were recorded in our earnings per share, the Swiss pension gain and deferred tax I talked about earlier
  -0.14  0 Until then, if you have any questions or queries, of course, we have a very active Investor Relations department
   0.20  0 All the information and contact details are on our website
   0.00  1 Thank you very much for your time this morning, and have a good day
   0.00  1 Thank you

---FILE: Croda International Plc.txt

   0.25  0 Some Colchester fans in the room as well, so you better be quiet
  -0.20  0 Some really, really interesting disruptive technologies, we -- you'll hear the word disruption a lot more from Croda, some of these technologies potentially are very disruptive for our industry for the next 3 to 5 years, and we're acquiring them at quite a rate at the moment, that will continue
   0.00  1 And good returns for our shareholders, dividend up again for the 26th year
   0.00  1 Just getting behind the numbers a bit, consistent top and bottom line growth coming through
   0.00  1 Constant currency in the core business up 5.6%
   0.00  1 So margins nudging up
   0.00  1 They're all growing broadly mid-single-digit, Personal Care, Life Sciences, Performance Technologies, 3 strong legs of growth now
   0.00  1 Life Sciences and Performance Technologies, don't forget about them, some good growth, very strong structural growth coming through
   0.00  1 So our top 10 customers represent about 16% of our sales, growing at 4.7%, the next 10 are growing at 4.3%, and the rest, which is a big number, it's about 26,000, growing about 4.6%
   0.00  1 So consistent growth right across our customer categories around the world
  -0.05  1 If there has been a change over the last 2 or 3 years, it's been -- we've always seen good growth with the rest section, the light blue, we've been negative with the top 10 and top 20, and it's the big customers that are starting to grow again for Croda, which is important, important message to get across
  -0.14  0 In the top 10 or top 20, there's quite an equal spread between the 3 businesses
  -0.10  0 Of course, there are a number of multinationals but -- in Personal Care, but there's quite a few Crop and Health Care, and industrial customers in there, too
   0.00  1   And all major regions are growing as well
   0.00  1 That's Personal Care -- North America are up 8%
   0.00  1 Personal Care has been the pick of the sectors in many ways from where it was 18 months ago, strong sales growth
  -0.20  0 And a big -- quite a lot of self-help there from the business
   0.00  1 And this general flight to premium is really accelerating
   0.25  0 Most of the invention in the industry is going at the top of Personal Care
   0.00 -1 The slight knock in margin is all down to mix
  -0.14  1 Crop protection becoming a world-class business for Croda, no doubt about it
  -0.33  0 We've restructured -- we feel like the restructuring is complete
   0.00  1 And we're ahead of our plans
   0.00  1 By the end of this year, we'll have doubled the return on sales in that business over 2.5 years, very good business for Croda
  -0.20  0 I think a point on the API contract
   0.00 -1 I think we've talked to you in recent times about the pricing pressure in that business
  -0.33  0 So we agreed to exit that contract
   0.00  1 But the rest of the business behind that is in good shape and APIs generally for the group -- for Life Sciences is about 3%
   0.00  1 But Life Sciences generally in very good -- a very good place
   0.00  1 Incotec ready for growth, and Health and Crop in good places, too
   0.00  1 We are transitioning to more focus innovation, becoming a really consistent performer in Croda and it's a strong third leg, not a weak third leg
   0.00  1 So we expect that growth to continue
   0.00  1 So really good performance for Performance Technologies
   0.00  1 So we're firing on all cylinders with the 3 businesses, we're in a good position with them all
   0.00  1  Thanks, Steve, and morning, everybody
   0.00  1 Sales were GBP 1.37 billion, up just over 10% in reported terms
  -0.17  0 tax legislation on our deferred tax liability
   0.00  1 So overall adjusted EPS, 179p, as Steve said, up nearly 15%
   0.00  1 So a very strong performance and on the back of that we've proposed a full year dividend of 81p, which is an increase of 9.5%
   0.00 -1 A bit more in the final, because the interim was up only about 6.5%
   0.00  1 So the final dividend up double-digit
   0.00  1 We saw a steady return to organic growth during the first half year with some impact on second quarter from timing of Easter, and then we saw that growth accelerate during the second half year
   0.00 -1 At the same time, we rebalanced the Performance Technology portfolio, the second half year saw lower growth, which is what we indicated we expected to happen at the half year and this was because we were focusing on value rather than volume growth
   0.00 -1 Currency translation all very much first half, second half actually slightly negative as sterling strengthened
   0.00  1 In Life Science, we have 6% volume growth
   0.00  1 On Performance Technologies, volume growth of 1%
   0.00  1 And overall for the group, a nice balance of 4.6% constant currency sales, include 3% of volume growth
   0.00  1 So good recovery, good growth in volume demonstrated in those numbers
   0.00  1 Growth in crop and also the high end of health delivery systems and the return on sales in Life Science is now back above 30%, as Steve highlighted
   0.20  0 tax and the mix of where the profit comes from now in overseas terms
   0.00  1 Giving us overall very healthy growth of 8 -- of 14.9% to 179p EPS
  -0.05  0 In interest, first of all, capitalized interest, we've been capitalizing interest associated with the biosurfactant plant as we're required to do under accounting standards, and that capitalization will cease at the end of the first quarter when that plant is due to come on stream
   0.11  0 And then on tax rate, this is where we get the benefit to EPS of the impact of the U.S
   0.00 -1 So it'll bring us down from 26.8% to low 24% level
   0.00  1 So meaningful accretion to EPS expected from the U.S
  -0.09  1 As a result, we expect that to reverse the free cash flow decline that we saw in '17, clearly driven by the CapEx and see that free cash flow step up again in 2018
   0.08  0   In terms of net debt, despite the lower cash flow, we saw net debt broadly stable and leverage decline slightly
  -0.17  0 And therefore, we would not anticipate any cash deficit payments for the next 3 years on the U.K
   0.00 -1 Anyway, back to -- we're not sure
   0.14  0 Great, I mean, what Jez has described in detail is the broad nature of the growth
   0.00  1 Its started to get growth right around the world, across customers, across all sectors as well
  -0.07  0 Our job now is to try and stretch that growth and we've identified 6 growth buckets for Croda for the next 3 to 5 years as part of our strategic planning, some of them you've -- are well known to you, some of them are quite new to you
   0.00  1 It's not just about renewable ingredients, it's about high- purity ingredients and our consumers want safer and -- safer products and products free from -- products with impurity-free chemicals in them
   0.00  1 It's very important
   0.00  1 So safety is becoming an essential part of the sustainability story too
  -0.12  0 We've been ever much that since 1925, but I think the key points on here are not so much the products, it's the bars at the top
   0.10  0 Virtually, all the innovation in Personal Care is at the top of Personal Care and the small- and medium-sized customers out there are targeting that as are the multinationals now
  -0.08  1 Often our products are at very small inclusion levels and -- but they are crucial to the end marketing strategy of our customers, and they create a lot of value for our customers
   0.00  1 You have to have absolute product stewardship with your products, they want more and more efficacy from our ingredients
   0.00  1 So very powerful and again, you'll hear a lot more at the Capital Markets Day
   0.00  1 It's getting closer to our customers and a NPP metric is a crucial nonfinancial metric for Croda, up 75% over the last 5 years, significant improvement
  -0.05  1 And a lot of that is just working side-by-side with them in our laboratories with their problems, very powerful, pretty simple, but it's driving a lot of growth in Asia and a lot of the reason that our growth in Asia is getting consistent now is having these R&D laboratories close to our end markets growing at 6%
  -0.20  1 And in South Africa, we opened a new claims laboratory there in the Personal Care recently, sales up 15%
   0.07  0 It's working with university startups, make the universities themselves with open innovation programs and it's all to look at R&D in a different way
   0.00  1 More external R&D is helping us solve problems quicker for our customers and our future customers
   0.14  0 But the graph shows you that our open innovation program now is really gathering pace
   0.00  1 And we've got maybe 200 projects and the government funding has helped that to the tune of around GBP 12 million, most of that from the British government
   0.00  1 So we work very well with the universities
   0.00  1 And as I said, it's giving us virtually free expertise out there
   0.00  1 It's helping us solve problems in a quicker and more agile way
   0.25  0 That started as an open innovation project
   0.00  1 What we're after was the bottom bullet point, access to unique microbial -- marine microbial library, really good
  -0.08  1 There's lot more plants under the ground than there is above the ground, and we think this is a source of new generation claims for our existing and new customers, some really good chemistry there
   0.00  1 So we're delighted with that, and there will be a number of product launches coming from Nautilus in the next 2 or 3 years with claims that Croda has never made before
  -0.08  0 And also in technology acquisitions, we're looking for more disruption, emphasis on disruption, bigger bets, bigger opportunities
   0.00  1 And if I just look at what we bought over the last -- what we bought or built ourselves in new technologies, IRB, biotechnology, and the rest, growing at 65% compound growth
   0.00  1 It starts from a small base, but this is starting to help the growth at the top of the company, shaping the company
   0.00  1 So it's helping the NPP programs as well
   0.00  1 So that's why we're accelerating our capture of technologies
   0.00  1 Enza is sugar chemistry, really clever chemistry, very IP-rich, and it's sustainable surfactants for the future playing on the sustainability trend
   0.00  1 IonPhasE is a really interesting one for electrostatic protection
  -0.08  1 And that's something that we quite -- quite a weird one for Croda, but when we looked into it, looks really perfect for Martin's business in smart materials
   0.07  0 We'll announce them collectively, but we're interested in weird technologies, technologies even some of our customers aren't thinking about yet, but we're interested in great people as well
   0.00  1 So it's quite -- this is an exciting area of growth for Croda
   0.00  1 And our sustainability story is gathering pace
   0.05  0 Jez talked about the biosurfactant plant, award winning as well, just on stream at the end of this quarter, 100% bio-based, 100% renewable, low carbon footprint, and this USDA bio- preferred is the independent stamp that you need that says, this is a green -- these are green surfactants
  -0.11  0 And if I look at the sustainability trend in Personal Care, 1 in 2 products   at the moment contain sustainability claims
   0.00  1 So you start playing with big numbers and we just need to convert a small number of these across to the green chemistry, and we'll be in a very good shape
   0.00  1 So we are very well protected in that respect
   0.00  1 And the customer interest is gathering pace all the time, big surfactant conference in January, and we have all of those and more very interested in the technology
   0.00  1 So it's a great story, we expect good growth to come from that and it's -- Croda putting our money where our mouth is on sustainability, no doubt about it
   0.00  1 And we like that, we like that in Croda
   0.17  0 Virtually 60%, 70% of the innovation across all of our businesses is coming from these type of customers
  -0.06  0 We're investing in more disruptive technologies, it's all about R&D as well taking bigger bets, digital and manufacturing capabilities are an essential part of our offerings
  -0.40  0 So let's stop there and take your questions
   0.00  1 We increased that to 4% through the second half
   0.00  1 We would increase that again this year to 5% growth
   0.00 -1 And probably 5% probably about right for the group, mid-single digits, with Life Sciences a little bit ahead of that and Performance Technologies a little bit below that
   0.00  1 And with a bit of margin increase coming through on the industrial businesses
   0.00 -1 As in the net debt to EBITDA is 1x around it, but also the -- once the dividend increased the ordinary one, the payout ratio actually came down a little bit
   0.07  0 So can you put some more color around your thinking when it comes to cash returns, please?  Yes, we haven't changed our view around capital allocation since we introduced the policy 3 years ago
   0.00  1 We'll -- we expect cash flow to be good in 2018
   0.14 -1 Clearly, there might be a little bit more reported currency headwind in 2018 depending on what sterling does
   0.00  1 So I think the ordinary dividend, we're always keen to maintain a good payout ratio and make sure we can drive that forward broadly in line with growth in earnings
   0.09  0 And so then it leaves the opportunity to use the balance sheet and the cash generation for 1 of 2 things really, inorganic expansion through M&A or returns to shareholders
   0.00  1 And we're very clear that if we see opportunities to grow beyond just the technology acquisitions, which are quite small in terms of outlay
   0.11  0 Then we will -- bolt-ons, maybe something bigger if those opportunities develop in the chemical sector over the coming period
   0.00  1 You talked about the strong growth in Actives during the year, double-digit growth
   0.00  1 You talk about Personal Care overall growing up 5%
  -0.33  0 And then the second question is on the PT side
  -0.17  0 It hasn't -- we thought it would be more of an impact in quarter four than there actually was with the plant outage
   0.00  1 Formulation business, broadly mid-single-digit
   0.00  1 It's been a really good performance there
   0.11  0 And if you look at -- if you look into 2018, we see broadly 5% there, a little bit more in Actives, similar in formulations and may be similar in effects as well
   0.17  0 So around mid-single digit for formulations and effects, maybe slight formulation below 3%, 4%; effects mid-5%; and active, a little bit more
   0.00  1 But all businesses are in a good shape
   0.00  1 And smart materials, low single-digit, I think, getting behind the numbers
   0.00  1 That's really what we're seeing as the core of smart materials, but clearly driving to new technologies so that we can increase the proportion of NPP and so forth there
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions, if I may
  -0.05  0 Firstly, on press reports that you're in conversation with Ashland, irreconcilable differences or part of a longer-term kind of courting process, maybe you could explain the attractions and what happened there in a bit more detail
  -0.12  0 Let me try and take that all in one, because it partly answers Gunther's question about share returns as well
  -0.14  0 But we don't talk about press speculation or rumors, we will say that for sure
   0.00  1 We've got, in many way, optionality to do what we want
   0.17  0 And in many ways, one great way of transforming a business is just bringing some of these technologies on it
   0.14  0 But of course, we do look at -- it's like a pyramid effect for our M&A
   0.00 -1 We don't feel like we have to
   0.00  1 We keep our -- the 2 words that we use at Cowick Hall a lot are patience and discipline
   0.00 -1 And so that hasn't changed
   0.00  1 We've got very good growth now in all 3 businesses
   0.00  1 In many ways, the investment is good enough around the world to get continued growth
  -0.10  1 And whether you hear the word disruption more and more or digital or sustainable -- sustainability, it's all about getting faster growth in the business
   0.00  1 And a reminder to everybody, the cheapest way of growing is to grow organically
   0.00  1 And Gunther's point is we still -- there is a good chance that we still could do some sort of special return or a share return of some description, cash return of some description to shareholders this year
   0.00  1 But yes, we're in a good place, we've got growth
  -0.20  1 And then my second question, you talked about margin gains, Steve, in the PT business this year
   0.00  1 But I also saw, in the second half, a very strong performance in Life Sciences
  -0.11  0 I mean, on the first question, our priority is to do the right thing in terms of returns, in terms of shareholder value for ourselves and for you
   0.12  0 So if we could find the right opportunity from an inorganic point of view, of course, we would look at that first
   0.00  1 We're good at acquisitions
   0.25  0 And so if there's a right opportunity, we will look closely at it
   0.00  1 And you can look good after a year or 2
  -0.17  0 I could write a book about value destruction in M&A for the chemical industry
   0.20  0 They tend to go up, because the natural innovation programs will drive it   up
   0.00  1 It's going to continue to climb and with very good margins in Incotec as well, so a high-margin business
   0.33  0 So in many ways, it depends on the mix in that business
   0.00  1 But Health Care, Incotec, very good and Crop Care is good too as well
  -0.12  0 Just one question on the acceleration in growth you've seen in Q3 and Q4
  -0.20  0 We've seen that with other Personal Care-exposed companies as well
   0.00  1 Or do you think there is some sort of share shifts happening, maybe your exposure to Indies, as you call them, is helping you grow faster than your competition?  I mean, the macro point is an interesting one
   0.00  1 So anybody in that luxury end screens well for that
   0.07  0 So I think there's a little bit -- it's macro, but most of it is self-help from Croda doing the right things and its constant innovation machine pointed in the right part of Personal Care
   0.00 -1 And I think the other point to make would be North America, I think from a regional point, we have seen North America come back
   0.00  1 Some of that is macro -- a little bit of that is macro, but we've seen good growth in the other 2 businesses in North America, too
  -0.11  0 You can't comment on press speculation, but you can comment on the mechanism for a large transaction, I guess
  -0.50  0 That's question number one
  -0.33  0 Question number two is around Life Science
   0.00  1 Again, Q4 was exceptionally strong, and I'm just not sure what the key drivers were bottom up for that
  -0.50  0 Well, just the Life Science -- I mean, the first question, good question
   0.00 -1 The culture of this company is too important for them
   0.00  1 And Croda's business model is very powerful, and we're one of the best off balance sheet -- value in the company is the selling network
  -0.11  1 Do you want to do the Life Science question?  So I suppose all 3 of the businesses within Life Science did particularly well in the fourth quarters
   0.00  1 So it's a very busy period and quite hard to call in, and it was a very successful fourth quarter
   0.00  1 Crop protection, the above-the-ground crop treatment, the traditional Croda business, extremely strong, had a very -- it was very flat first half, and second half was a real resurgence
   0.17  0 Clearly, long-term, the driver there is our collaboration with major ag chem companies
   0.00  1 And then Health Care had a good fourth quarter
  -0.25  0 And as Steve said, we did about GBP 11 million on that contract
  -0.11  1 So a little bit of help from the exit of the API contract, but mostly just really strong underlying performance in the 3 businesses
   0.00  1 And that's really, really important
   0.00  1 And that's a really -- it's a clever move for Croda as well, because we think that's accretive to the technology
   0.00  1 It's a gap in our technologies, and we think that's going to be helpful to our customers, big and small, in crop, too
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions
  -0.25  0 And the second question was on your digitization strategy
   0.00  1 In good shape, should be on stream at end of quarter 1
  -0.22  1 And the interesting thing is this customer buy-in, the customer interest is escalating quite quickly now, which is what we want
   0.00  1 2019 is the big year where we would get further growth, new growth, as we connect with all of our customers, big and small, to look at developing new white space with them, brand extension
   0.11  0  Yes, in terms of profit impact from simply replacing the suppliers effectively in the supply chain, which is what happens on day 1, we replaced the existing sort of roughly 20,000 tonnes of EO that we buy
   0.10  0 Yes, small single-digit millions of pounds profit impact, maybe GBP 4 million based on running for 3 quarters of the year
   0.00  1 It's a new marketing channel that will help us
   0.00  1 We're doing a lot of good digital stuff anyway
  -0.50  0 It's just exploiting it
  -0.25  0 And second question goes back to the PT growth
  -0.20  0 I mean, let me take the Life Science question
   0.11  0 I mean, Life Sciences for Croda of the high-purity excipients, it's all about stabilizing drug actives
   0.00 -1 What that means is it's very difficult to stabilize them in formulations
   0.06  0 And then the flight to performance that I mentioned before is all about if you can stabilize them well and get them targeted to the site that they need to be targeted to, whether it's part of your skin, part of your particular body, you'll get an increased performance
   0.29  0 So we spend a lot of time with our customers collaborating with them about how to stabilize the actives
   0.00  1 It's very important
   0.00  1 And we are creating a lot of value for our customers
   0.00  1 We like that
   0.00  1 They create value
   0.00  1 There's a big margin in it for Croda, and there's an even bigger margin in many ways for our customers
  -0.05  0 On the Omega-3?  Yes, on the Omega-3, so obviously it's quite a different platform to the rest of the Health Care business, which as you say is around the excipients, in particular the high-purity part of the excipients delivery systems
  -0.14  0 So we've got a couple of European generics, a lot smaller than the North America contract
   0.00  1 So a small platform, a bit of a ring fence platform, but one where we have some skills and expertise and where there could be some interesting things for the future
  -0.20  0  Maybe one question on NPP products
   0.10  0 So if it's patented, we've got something that you could -- what you want with NPP is you've got something that's valuable
   0.00  1 And this is the philosophy of Croda, your customers really need it and they want it and it creates a lot of value for them
   0.20  0 And if you've got that relationship with them, then that's perfect
    nan  1 We have more pricing power
  -0.17  0 We're not in that market -- our job is to create markets, in many ways, not destroy them
   0.50  0 Okay, great
   0.00  1 Well, thank you very much, everybody

---FILE: EVRAZ plc.txt

   0.33  0 Please go ahead, sir
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.29  0 It's my great pleasure to welcome you all to our 2017 full year results presentation
   0.00  1 2017 was a good year for EVRAZ
   0.00  1 Good market conditions endorse our efforts in product development and cost cutting have brought us to material improvement of all our financial metrics
   0.00  1 Robust free cash flow had allowed us to reduce net debt below $4 billion
   0.00  1 Safety remains our top priority
  -0.09  0 We have made all necessary efforts to analyze all these tragic events to make sure that relevant rates are minimum
   0.00  1 Our cost remains very competitive for the whole value chain in coal, iron ore and steel
   0.00  1 But we believe that expanding and diversifying our product portfolio and customer base is a foundation of robust development
   0.00  1 We also believe that retention of lower-cost position is critically important for the company, and we are putting a lot of efforts into that
   0.00  1 Our cost- cutting initiative generated additional $163 million of EBITDA effect
  -0.14  0 The measures that we undertake on cost cutting and product development are discussed in detail in our press release and in our annual report, which was also published today
  -0.20  0 I would be happy to answer any questions concerning that in our Q&A session
   0.08  0 More than 50% of our development CapEx was spent on constructing the new blast furnace #7 in Nizhniy Tagil, and there are 25 went towards warehouse projects in EVRAZ North America
   0.00  1   As you know, on the back of strong free cash flow and debt reduction, we have resumed dividend payments already last year
   0.33  0 So now, Nikolay, please continue
   0.00  1  Thank you, Alexander, and good afternoon, everybody
   0.00  1 Our EBITDA increased by 70% year-on-year, and we were able to reach net leverage of a $1.5 million, which, in the end, allow us to consider second interim dividend and announce a dividend policy
   0.00  1 Our EBITDA in 2017 is record high for the last 4 years and reached $2.6 billion
   0.00  1 In Steel segment, revenues increased by almost 41% year-on-year to $7.7 billion or 63% of the group's total before elimination
   0.00  1 The Steel segment's EBITDA improved, reflecting higher steel and vanadium prices and reflects on cost-cutting initiatives implemented in 2017
   0.00  1 In Coal segment, revenues surged by 67.5% year-on-year, supported largely by higher sales price
   0.00  1 In our North American segments, revenues also went up by more than 27% year-on-year
   0.00  1 The Steel North America segment's EBITDA also increased year-on-year
   0.00  1 Our free cash flow for 2017 was strong, $1.3 billion
  -0.06  0 Our free cash flow was also impacted by the proceeds from the disposal of some of our noncore assets, in particular, Nakhodka Trade Sea Port, Sukha Balka at Ukraine and Vametco, our vanadium operations in South Africa
  -0.11  0 Alexander has already elaborated on our CapEx, so I will stop on this slide just to summarize some results of the key projects that we have
   0.07  0 In 2017, our capital expenditure increased to $603 million compared with $428 million a year earlier due to significant expenses on major projects and the strengthening of the ruble exchange rate against the U.S
   0.08  0 EVRAZ NTMK continued to implement its 2 main construction projects during 2017, the blast furnace #7 and the new grinding ball mill, both of which are scheduled to be launched in the near future
   0.17  0 This was the last important module of the upgrade project, making it possible to achieve the projects full planned effect
   0.00  1 Throughout the year, we've repaid and refinanced several of our bank financing facilities, thus, reducing our financial leverage and debt service costs
   0.00 -1 Due to the decreasing total debt and our efforts to refinance existing facilities in 2017, interest expense in respect of loans, bonds and notes, decreased to $394 million versus $439 million a year earlier
   0.00  1 Our maturity profile is in a good shape and only $63 million maturing in 2018
  -0.08  0 We have a few slides on our operational performance shown in the presentation, which we decided not to talk through, but instead, give you more time for your questions
  -0.50  0 And now, we are ready to take your questions
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.20  0    [Operator Instructions] And your first question is coming from the line of Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies
   0.09 -1 I guess, I was a bit surprised in the release today and to read your comment about continued price competition despite rising demand expectations
  -0.20  0 And perhaps, you can quantify what sort of margin you lost as a result of this
   0.00  1 So market is growing
   0.10  0 I mean, it's not a huge, let's say, growth space, but depending on the product
   0.00  1 Last year, we have seen growth for various products, let's say, ranging from 3% to 7% per year
   0.07 -1 And what it practically means, it means that we, let's say, reduce, for example, sales of some of our material for construction last year, because, let's say, in order to reach, let's say, remote destinations, for example, central part of Russia, because of a relatively high transportation cost, now all that didn't make a lot of sense for us
  -0.14  0 And we do not exclude that similar situation may happen in 2018, and we would decide kind of opportunistically what to do
   0.00  1 We have, how to say, more, let's say, strategic growth there
   0.15  0 We are, let's say, trying to develop better use of those profiles as a placement of use of concrete, for example, in construction
   0.18  0 I think that we are making certain progress in that, which, at the same time, of course, it's not an easy issue and it takes some time
   0.05 -1 Can you walk us through what drove that somewhat disappointing price realization and how you expect that to progress into 2018 as your volumes grow?  Well, again, not an easy question to answer, because basically, what we are trying to achieve, we are trying to sell based on price formulas, which are basically a blend of doing business
   0.25 -1 And that's why effective price have gone a little bit down
   0.00  1 But I think that in the future, what we'll see is that, in general, demand for high-quality coals stay high
   0.05  0 And from that point of view, let's say, our logic in the formula when we are trying to push for   better portion of hard coking coal in that is probably a formula, which will, in the long term, work in the right direction for us
  -0.25  0 At the same time, again, short-term deviation may exist
  -0.33  0 Your next question is coming from the line of Dan Shaw
   0.20  0 Speaking about the CapEx, we believe that the number somewhere between $600 million and $700 million per year is an adequate number in the near future
   0.22  0 division and the improvements and the CapEx that you've spent there so far in the improvements you're mentioning
  -0.20  0   And your next question is coming from the line of Nikolay Sosnovskiy
  -0.50  0  I got several questions
   0.00  1 On the strategic outlook and your view on the cycle, basically, earnings have improved quite materially
  -0.33  0 That's my first part of the question
   0.11  0 It's -- is it a deal where -- let's say, right now, we are switching to new blast furnace #7, which should lead -- and this switch was in, whatever, let's say, few months should lead us for higher productivities than we had there with the old blast furnace
  -0.09  1 And again, difficult to say right now what sort of percentage it would be, but I would say that it is there and well, let's say, steel production will increase
   0.00  1 Speaking also in coking coal, we expect a certain volume increase this year
   0.12  0 We don't see any improvement in vanadium because -- well, to some extent, it would improve, but it would -- could probably come a little bit later on, because our mines also for vanadium feed stock, it is vanadium slab from Nizhniy Tagil
   0.00  1 So by increasing the iron productions there, we would increase also production of vanadium
  -0.14  0 And my second question is on dividend policy, which is kind of a new theme for EVRAZ
  -0.06  0 And what is kind of, not frustrating but a bit strange in a way that the minimum number introduced somehow relates, I think, to the bottom of the cycle earnings of EVRAZ and not the current quite healthy free cash flow generation and profits
  -0.12  0 So it's a little bit confusing in the way that the $300 million number relates to kind of different part of the cycle
   0.06  0 And I think that this is a   reasonable number in terms of, let's say, satisfying the needs of the company for development, also, let's say, debt management and the interest of our shareholders
   0.06  0 And you have seen yourselves that interim dividend, we're just paying in order, let's say, to satisfy because there's, in our view, possible balance between our creditors and shareholders
   0.00  1 Are you planning any kind of special dividends in the first half this year similar to what you did last year with Nakhodka and other assets included into the first half '17 dividend?  First of all, we did not make any special dividend last year, it was just an interim dividend, which was based on good and healthy free cash flow
  -0.12  0 Of course, let's say, dispose, Nakhodka made some contribution to that
  -0.11  0 So I don't think that we expect to make any special dividend just in relation with disposal of Dnepropetrovsk Sukha
  -0.25  0 This town is called [indiscernible] Your next question is coming from the line of Barry Ehrlich
  -0.67  0 I have 3 or 4 quite different questions, if I may
  -1.00  0 Those are my first 2 questions
   0.12  0  First of all, I would probably be not able to comment on the volume dynamics because I don't have this information in front of me
   0.00  1 So if we move from $42, the current price, which is $62.5, or whatever utilization price, then of course, it is 1.4 increase in revenue
  -0.25  0 Did I answer your question, sir? And your next question is coming from the line of [ Lada Korshunova ]
   0.00 -1 The line wasn't that so good
  -0.25  0 I'd like to repeat the question
  -0.07  0   And regarding the question with the buyer, is it the same that bought your raw material assets earlier this year?  It's the same group of companies who bought Sukha Balka
   0.50  0 Okay, great
  -0.20  0 And may I ask a couple of more questions?  Yes, sure
  -0.14  0 My second question is regarding your expectations for the situation with Section 232 in the U.S
  -0.20  0 And one more question is regarding the blast furnace #7 at NTMK
  -0.14  0 So we don't see any problem, let's say, to place this material to the market
   0.00  1 That's very interesting
  -0.50  0 And one last question is regarding China
   0.00  1 What we can see are -- we see that all campaigns, let's say, which the government is making there in order to improve ecological situation, first of all, and because of that closure of inefficient or, let's say, polluted steelmaking facilities, we see that it's kind of   real efforts, which leads to real reduction of steel volumes
  -0.25  0 Your next question is coming from the line of Nina Dergunova
  -0.50  0 [Technical Difficulty] Your next question is coming from Barry Ehrlich
   0.00 -1 It's probably a bit longer-term issue, which is, again, legitimate issue, but not an immediate one
  -0.50  0 And your next question is coming from Andrew Jones
  -0.33  0  I've got a few questions
  -0.50  0 That's my first question
  -0.20  0  Excuse me, could you repeat your question, because I really did not understand
  -0.50  0 That's my first question
  -0.08  0 We would rather prefer to see the outcome of this, let's say, Section 232, and then we will analyze and give comments on all the questions you have been asking
   0.20  0 for steelmaking now?  Again, it all depends because we have 2 steel plants, 2 EAFs in the U.S
  -0.12  0 But then, again, it's not [indiscernible] because, for example, in Rocky Mountains, we have -- we are cutting, let's say, around the billets
  -0.17  0 I mean, basically, for one product in Virginia, we are cutting slabs, and so on and so forth
  -0.33  0 And just another question on dividends
  -0.20  0 You -- I apologize, my line was cut off earlier, so you may have been asked this already
  -0.25  0 [Operator Instructions] We seem to have no further questions coming through
   0.50  0 Please continue
  -0.14  0    If there are no further questions, we thank you for taking your time and joining us today, and this concludes the call
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1  Thank you

   0.00  1                                                Thank you
   0.00  1 Good morning all
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.25  0 I would like to draw your attention to the disclaimer
   0.00  1 In the operations side, our silver production has increased by up to 69%, going from 34 -- a little bit over 34 million ounces of silver at the end on 2007 to 53.3 million ounces of silver
   0.00  1 But at the same time, we have increased silver reserves by 23% since IPO and gold reserves by 216% since IPO, going from 9 million ounces of gold to 35 -- just over 35 million ounces of gold
   0.00  1 On the exploration side, also some good numbers
   0.00  1 And that has helped us grown our rich silver resources by 177% to 2.3 billion ounces, and gold resources, we have grown over 3x, as I mentioned, from 9 million to just over 39 million ounces
   0.00  1 And as you know, we have a strong pipeline of growth prospects and projects, 1.8 million hectares of exploration and mining concessions in Mexico, just around 400,000 hectares of exploration concessions in Peru, making it the largest concession holding in Peru for a mining company
   0.17  0 And I think the only way now for mining having an integral approach, not only in production, but also in sustainability
   0.00  1 So this is what we call the value-creation cycle, starting with high-quality, low-cost, flexible operations
   0.00  1 Very importantly, and especially in environments that we live through the cycles in mining, a disciplined approach to development
   0.00  1 Also, San Julián, the growth along the lines of -- in terms of low cost of production at a similar level down Fresnillo
   0.00  1 And this is possible with a dedicated team, very experienced
   0.00  1 This team has been together for the last 25, 30 years, longer workforce, also making possible this growth and this approach
   0.00  1 That gave us, as I mentioned, increase in silver equivalent resources of 4.45 million ounces
  -0.08  0 If you divide these ounces that we just covered by the amount we have invested in exploration, gives approximately $25 per ounce discovery, which is quite outstanding, I would say
   0.00  1 Production growth: silver, 69%; and gold, 225%
   0.00  1 Thus making the strategy of balanced growth and returns
   0.00 -1 And as I mentioned in an environment in which many of mining competitors have gone through write-offs or write-downs, in our case, it's not been the case
  -1.00  0 In 2017, we have one fatality
  -0.14  0 So this is a pending aspect in a company to really go and achieve our objective of 0 fatalities
   0.00  1 So we are reinforcing this aspect that never gives you rest in our operations
  -0.29  1 And hopefully, with a new approach that we are implementing across all of our operations, we can finally fulfill our objective of 0 fatalities
   0.06  0 Well or better educated community gives you the possibility to start a dialogue really and making -- or being able to interact with them and try and to convey the message of why mining is important in these communities
   0.50  0 Construction of San Julián, as we mentioned, we achieved it
   0.00  1   And also, silver production at the Fresnillo mine was up
   0.00  1 And 2017, we've increased 4%
   0.00  1 So we are forecasting 7% to 9% further increase in production that will bring our silver production to 17.5 million to 18 million ounces of silver
   0.00 -1 We have a larger number of stopes and that gives us a possibility to forecast the larger production
   0.00  1 Gold, 38.5 million ounces in resources and 2.3 billion ounces of silver also went up
   0.00  1 And another characteristic, another mark in our operations, very good margins, 50.6% EBITDA margin as -- on a consolidated basis in our company
  -0.14  0 I would say that the cash generation in our operations is quite important, and that gives us the possibility to have cash in hand of $896 million
   0.33  0 Just some small information on the operations
   0.00  1 As I mentioned, Fresnillo is maintaining the upward trend, and we expect to do so in this year as well
   0.17  0 But basically, we keep on strengthening the infrastructure in Fresnillo
  -0.08  1 We are also bringing a -- onstream a new vertical conveyor, which is quite an alternative to a shaft and that will lower the haulage cost from the bottom part of the ore body
   0.00  1 And also, we are bringing a tunneling machine that will be ready in the last quarter of this year that will further increase the development rates
   0.00  1 Very good cash costs and remarkable increase in terms of reserves and resources
   0.00  1 We mentioned at a point in time to keep Centauro because we have further exploration potential to that
   0.00  1 But this increase in reserves to 7.7 million ounces, extending the mine life of Herradura, has given us the possibility of evaluating an expansion at Herradura
   0.00  1 Good news in terms of exploration
   0.00  1 In Ciénega, you may remember that we were evaluating at a point in time increasing the production to the west of Ciénega in the Taspana area
   0.06  0 With the exploration success we are having in the same Ciénega mine, we are changing that view and probably the increase in production will be in the same flotation plant in Ciénega instead of building it to the west, 25 kilometers of the Ciénega infrastructure
   0.00  1 Well, as I mentioned, Phase I is doing very well in terms of the production rate
   0.00  1 And Phase II, as I mentioned also, very good ramp-up last quarter of last year
   0.00  1 So further potential, exploration potential in the same district, more visible on the veins
   0.00  1 So a total $155 million investment, going very well, as you can see
   0.00  1 And then on the right, that section will help me illustrate what I mentioned, the growth in reserves to 7.7 million ounces
   0.00  1 And let's remember that when we commissioned the second dynamic leaching plant, we said this was going to help us extend the mine life of the Herradura mine on an average of 390,000 ounces per year to 12 years
  -0.20  0 Right now, we are moving 120 million tonnes per year between ore and waste
   0.00  1 But what we found so far is that the current production of 120 million is the best alternative so far
   0.12  0 Instead of investing heavily in equipment through expansion, I think it's a better case the way we are doing it
   0.00 -1 Unfortunately, I think we were a bit optimistic
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1 Good morning
   0.00  1 This is -- this triangle shows the very strong growth pipeline that the company has
   0.00  1 And this strong pipeline gives us a potential to develop large, world-class, low-cost mines -- new mine
   0.00  1 We're very active right now
   0.00  1 Octavio has described the development projects which are going very well
   0.07  0 And we're also moving -- this year, we'll move to PEA these 4 advanced exploration and prefeasibilities projects: Centauro Deep, Orisyvo, Guanajuato and Rodeo
   0.00  1 Guanajuato, which is a district that our mother company worked years ago, Fresnillo has continued to explore there, and it's looking very good
   0.00 -1 Coming down to these prospects in drilling
   0.00  1 We've had good results in the Tajitos property, which is in the Herradura District; at the Candameña property, which is in the Orisyvo District; at San Juan, which is a prospect that we've resumed exploring, it's in Durango
   0.00  1 Further down the triangle, we've had good results at Lejano, the exploration that's in early stage that's in the Herradura District; at Uruachi, which is on the bottom right side the triangle, which is within the Orisyvo district
   0.00  1 And also a couple of the properties in Peru are doing very well at Sto
   0.00  1 It's a good budget, $200 million for 2018
   0.14  0 33% of the budget will be spent at the advanced exploration projects and 25% at new properties for the future
   0.50  0 But it's not any old land position
   0.00  1 So we're well located for the future there
  -0.25  0 The blue bar there, we have 38.4 million ounces of gold resources at the beginning of the year
  -0.17  1 And at the end of the year, 2017, that was increased to 38.5 million ounces, the blue bar on the right
  -0.14  0 You can see on the bar on the left, at the beginning of the year, our resources were 2.17 billion ounces of silver
  -0.17  0 And you can see at the end of the year, they were increased to, which is the blue bar on the right, 2.32 billion ounces of silver
   0.00  1 That's an increase of 7%
  -0.10  0 It was mostly done, look at the big green bar, at the Saucito mine, where a dozen drill rigs are working at surface
  -0.25  0 So you can see on the bar on the left, the blue bar, gold reserves at the beginning of 2017 were 9.54 million ounces of gold
  -0.17  1 These were substantially increased, and see the bar on the right, to 11.7 million ounces of gold
  -0.11  1 The big jump, of course, is the green bar there, Herradura, where we increased the reserves at Herradura, 2.5 million ounces
   0.00 -1 The gold reserves came down slightly at Saucito and at Ciénega
   0.00  1 Very good shape, our gold reserves
  -0.14  0 As our silver reserves, as you can see on 24 -- Page 24, the blue bar, at beginning of the year, we had 570 million (sic) [ 530 million ] ounces of silver reserves
  -0.17  0 They came down, you can see the red bar on the left, at the Fresnillo mine
   0.00 -1 The silver reserves came down because at the Fresnillo mine, we concentrated on our development work on increasing production rather than convert resources to reserves at that mine
   0.00 -1 Similarly, at Ciénega, there's a slight reduction, 12% in the -- 12 million ounces in silver reserves
   0.00  1 So we're in good shape
   0.00  1 I think that we have a very strong future on its reserves, resources and new mines
   0.25  0 It's always a pleasure to be here and be able to share our financial results with you
   0.12  0 Where we do see an important increase is on the base metals, in lead and zinc, which are our by-products
   0.14 -1 However, with the important increases in prices that we saw versus last year of 24% in the case of lead and 33% in the case of zinc, they did have a material impact, both on our sales, profits and also in our cash costs when you credit back the base metals
   0.12  0 And where you see a real effect in terms of our cost is when you look at the average spot exchange rate throughout the year
  -0.25  0 As you can see in 2016, we had a 20% devaluation, which had an important impact on our numbers, basically on our deferred taxes
  -0.08  0 Again, given the fact that we had a very important devaluation in 2016 and a slight revaluation in 2017, that meant that in 2016 we recognized a very important effect on the deferred taxes
  -0.11  1 In terms of the average spot exchange rate, as you can see, we had a very slight devaluation of only 1.5%, still favorable in terms of our costs
  -0.05  0 In 2016, we had a deflation of 8.08%, mainly driven by the huge devaluation and the impact that, that has on our peso-denominated costs versus 2017 where we saw a cost inflation of 6.36%, mainly driven by the increase in electricity prices and also the increase in diesel prices
   0.00  1 But I think overall, it was a good year
   0.00  1 First, I will touch on the increase in adjusted revenues, where that came from
  -0.20  0 Here, we show the breakdown by mine and also by metal of our revenues
   0.14  0 And as I mentioned, zinc and lead, which are our by-products, they used to be around 6%, 5% of our total revenues
   0.20  0 Let's move to the next page, Gaby, please
  -0.20  1 In other words, the increase -- the 24% increase that's shown in the green bar
   0.00  1 So it's good to know that most of that increase in adjusted production cost is related to volume
   0.00  1 So translating that in terms of production cost, that represented an increase of $40 million
   0.00  1 Thirdly, we've had increases in maintenance and also we -- an increase in the consumption of consumables and also some services at our mines, which represented around an increase of $18 million
   0.00 -1 The fourth column is an unusual one
  -0.40  0 We were not going to throw that to the waste because it had good content, so we decided to process that
   0.00 -1 And we also had less development works that were taken to the income statement in other mines, which lowered our adjusted production cost by $10.5 million
   0.25  0 Moving on now to the consolidated gross profit
   0.00  1 Again, on the right-hand side, we see the green bar, which shows the $43 million increase in gross profit
  -0.20  0 And all the other bars simply show how we get -- how we got to that
   0.50 -1 So that had an effect of increasing our -- decreasing our gross profit by $48 million
   0.50  0 So with that, we get to the $43.3 million change in gross profit
  -0.20  0 Very briefly, just a breakdown of the $141 million in terms of exploration expenses
  -0.50  0 So that's more or less the breakdown there
   0.00  1 We had a good year also in terms of cash generation
   0.00  1 So that's good to know
   0.00  1 And also, the fact that we closed the -- I would say, with a very healthy cash balance of very close to $900 million at the end of the year
  -0.20  0 Next, on Page 35, just a brief breakdown of our investments in CapEx
   0.00  1 I think we have a very, very solid balance sheet
   0.33  0 Move on to the next page, please
   0.00  1 But if you would like to look at it from a gold perspective, given the fact that 50% of our sales the previous year were gold, then you would see that we had a 4.7% increase in our cash cost
   0.00  1 I think we are very competitive and one of the lowest all-in sustaining, all-cash cost businesses compared to our peers
   0.11  0 The last part, I'd like to touch on the [indiscernible] development and construction of the projects
   0.00  1 We do have exploration potential above the 7.7 million ounces of reserves that obtained -- obtaining resources
   0.11  0 And whenever we achieve a larger resource base, we will continue doing the evaluation of a potential expansion of the pit
   0.00  1 For the time being, it's at 120 million tonnes per year, producing on average the 90,000 ounces of gold over the mine life and further potential at depth I mentioned
   0.12  0 The basic concept that we will be reviewing along the lines of exploration success in the coming years and evaluation of the potential as such
   0.00  1 With this, we have 2018 and '19 a flat silver production and going up in 2020, as we expect production coming from the Fresnillo expansion to 9,000
   0.00  1 And the front -- further increase in production at San Julián
  -0.25  0 This year, coming down in 2019 and 2020 to $725 million and $590 million with a breakdown of the sustaining growth
  -0.11  0 2020 is not kind of that CapEx reflected, so the previous chart on Page 39, yes, we should make that correction
  -0.12  0 Okay? Well, here you have a company that has been performing these last 10 years according to the objectives we've set at that time
   0.00  1 Very much on track to doubling our production we had in 2008
   0.00  1 And growing in productions
   0.00  1 Very disciplined in terms of capital allocation and   we -- probably will be -- will grow [ single ] stream
   0.00  1 Cash generation, ample EBITDA margins and a very focused approach to growth and returns
   0.00  1 Continue investing in exploration, as I mentioned, it's quite remarkable metric that we've achieved in recent years
   0.00  1 Optimize the operations
   0.00  1 Just to conclude, reiterate our investment case, high-quality, low-cost, flexible operations; a disciplined approach to development, very important
   0.00  1 Strong balance sheet, further grow and invest in those projects and prospects that are on the lines of foreign operations and commitment to sustainability, which is the only way that we continue mine life
  -0.14  0 And with that, operator, have -- we've concluded the presentation, and we would open up for questions first here in the room and then after via call
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 And on the resources, the resources went up strongly at Herradura the year before
   0.20  0 Also, the Pyrites Plant as well, although we are not changing the conclusion periods for that plant, but we have changed or moved a little bit from one to the other one
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions
  -0.11  0 On cost inflation, last year, you gave specific guidance, I wasn't sure if I missed that in the press release, but what are you thinking particularly on the electricity and the labor and contracting sites for this year?    Sure
   0.00  1 So you came in slightly above..
  -0.12  0 And then particularly electricity, contractors, labor, that sort of breakdown, if you can give any color there
  -0.17  0 And we're not expecting, but we are assuming for our budgeting purposes, that we will not see a devaluation
   0.22  0 Then you talked about it, maybe the mine being in a better position, the 9,000 tonne per day target being brought forward
  -0.09  0 And then maybe talk a little bit about the grade projections sort of past 2018, given that you've kind of underperformed there for the last couple of years
   0.00  1 2017 is 4%, which we aimed for initially 7% to 10%, of course, and we ended up at 4% increase
  -0.14  0 Hopefully, with the new contractors coming in the following couple of months, we can reinforce that and be ready for the contract production
   0.12  0 If that is proven successful, what we will   do probably is to get rid of some of the smaller contractors that are not performing well, but we will do that until October
   0.00 -1 Looks like it's been reduced by 10% to 12% versus what was given at the half year
  -0.17  0 And then also, my second question, just following on from the first on the CapEx guidance
  -0.11  0 Just if you could provide a bit more breakdown or granularity on what you missed on approved projects for 2019 and '20?  Sure
  -0.33  0 Another one is also in Saucito, but not drastically, but slightly
  -0.20  0 Yes, we have the breakdown for San Julián, the vein systems
  -0.25  0  And then the CapEx, the unapproved proportion of CapEx for next year and 2020
   0.07  0 And in 2020, we would have 1/3 approximately of Ciénega expansion, which is not board-approved yet; Juanicipio, to conclude that project, the construction of that project, a portion of Juanicipio, which is not approved -- board-approved
  -0.50  0    Last couple of questions
  -0.20  0 You mentioned that it looks like it's been delayed by 12 months
  -0.33  0 We've delayed it probably by 6 months
  -0.07  1 But we've been doing it because we are producing already some pyrites concentrate and some silver content but as the pyrite in Saucito has the capacity to treat also the portion coming from Fresnillo, we will be able to preserve that [indiscernible] happens
   0.00  1 At Saucito, it was up pretty significantly, 29% year-on year, and I think 20% at Ciénega as well
   0.08  0 So what format would this expansion potentially take that you mentioned that [indiscernible] has a higher reserve position?  It would be a lay back of the pit, of course, and a higher tonnage milled per year
   0.10  0 So a better case was to still at this level with the levels of resources and reserves to keep on the current production [indiscernible]
   0.12  0 And then you produce more ore out of the same tonnage as you would have a stronger [indiscernible] so that's what we're aiming for
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions
   0.00 -1 On your sustaining CapEx guidance for '19 and '20, it looks much below '18 and also below 2017 level while production is flat in '19 and actually rising in '20
   0.00 -1    No, that simply reflects the fact that some of our providers lowered their prices on certain operating materials
  -0.50  0 And for this year, it's going to be the opposite
   0.00 -1 Whereas, last year, we had a reduction -- an important reduction in tires, in explosives and in sodium cyanide
  -1.00  0 Third question
  -0.25  0 The distance to the waste dumps has to do with it, was shortened
  -0.40  0 You can store the waste there, not bring it to the waste dumps
  -0.25  0 So probably if we go and set an objective for the coming years, it would be more likely that we come up with a new objective in July [indiscernible]
   0.00 -1 What were the main drivers behind that?    Herradura came down
  -1.00  0 And then I have one last question
   0.12  0 Could you give us some information around what that is and [indiscernible]?  It's in development and exploration and providing some ore as well
  -0.14  0 And we've found the extension to these from those bench [indiscernible] Follow-up question
   0.00  1 Obviously, you have very strong track record in paying out the dividend and you have a very clear policy as well
   0.00  1  Well, as we've done in the past, I mean, consistency, I believe, is what the -- somehow sustains the company from somewhat -- to maintain the [indiscernible] strategy
  -0.20  0 Having quite a large exploration portfolio, I don't see good chances to go in M&A
   0.00  1 Exploring our own projects and prospects, bringing those that make sense along the lines in terms of quality, low cost has paid out for the company
   0.14  0 In the area of Orisyvo we've done some acquisitions as well just to further strengthen the area
   0.00  1 And as we mentioned, our strategy to balance growth and returns support really the [indiscernible]
  -0.29  0 Operator, are there any questions via phone? [Operator Instructions] And we have one question already from Daniel Major from UBS
  -1.00  0    Three questions
   0.10  0 I mean, first one, there is the recurring theme that your results of meeting the [indiscernible] of the construction side but pushing out the growth profile over the subsequent years
  -0.17  1  [Foreign Language]  No production, we feel quite comfortable
   0.00  1 Of course, as we mentioned, I mean, the track record that we've done over the last 10 years, it is on target at the long-term level
  -0.33  0 However, I recognize that on year-to-year, it may be changing, but not drastically
  -0.33  0 Well, we have in front of us the 2018, which is quite firm
   0.00  1 Whenever we optimize it, it's good
   0.00 -1 Fresnillo, I think, has been the case in which we've been falling short of our expectations in the past
   0.00  1 And   that's why it's been 2 years in which we have increased the production
   0.20  0 It's just a matter of workforce that we will be achieving with contractors
   0.50  0  Well, succession planning
  -0.60  0  Any more questions?  Any further questions, operator? We have no further questions in the queue

    Differences: 201/653


---FILE: Glencore plc.txt

  -0.12  0 The format this morning will be, as usual, presentation by Ivan and Steve, and then followed immediately afterwards by questions and answers
   0.00  1 Okay, good morning
   0.00  1 You can see the adjusted EBITDA of the group is $14.8 billion, which is up 44%; and adjusted EBIT is $8.6 billion, up 118% from 2016
   0.00  1 Net income is $5.8 billion, which is up 319%
   0.00  1 Funds from operation, $11.6 billion, up 49%
   0.00  1 Once again, the [ crux period ], a differentiation of Glencore, performs very well again
   0.00  1 And when markets are tighter, commodity price is higher, we're up towards the top end of the range
   0.00  1 And as you can see, we got an EBIT of $3 billion, which is up 3% from 2016
  -0.11  0 And like-for-like, because of adjustment for the ag business because we only account for 50% of the ag business during 2017 as opposed to 2016, is already 10% up
   0.00  1 Strong performance across the board on the metals and minerals and the energy product business on the trading, up 28% and 9%, respectively
  -0.20  1 And as you can see, against our competitors who have had difficult years, the ag business performed very well
   0.00  1 Really, Tier 1 assets performing very well on the cost side of the curve
  -0.10  0 And post credits, our copper is $0.87 per pound; zinc, negative $0.16 per pound; post credits, $0.10 per pound; ex the credit, nickel $0.191; and coal, we're realizing $32 margins
   0.00  1 So exceptionally strong on the cost performance across the board, which once again proves we really have Tier 1 assets low cost and long reserves
   0.00 -1 Naturally, there were some emerging inflationary pressures and ForEx impacts across the board on the costs
   0.00  1 However, we're fortunate these were more than offset by the higher by-product credits, which we're getting on the various commodities that we produce, and that has counteracted the inflationary cost pressure, which all miners are seeing across the board
  -0.10  1 As we've always said, Glencore has a conviction to create value through partnerships, M&A and organic reinvestment
   0.20  0 We're not sitting on our hands if opportunities present themselves
   0.00  1 And if they make sense and they fit our business model, we'll look at them, but we do have strong criteria, investment criteria, whether we do go ahead with them
   0.00  1 And we have a strong partner for future growth in those businesses
   0.00  1 We formed BaseCore, our royalty stream business with Ontario Teachers, and we'll use that as another vehicle where we can grow our business
   0.00  1 Safety, once again, an important feature of Glencore
  -0.17  0 We do employ 146,000 employees, so we have a large amount of employees as opposed to our peers
  -0.09  0 We do operate in difficult areas around the world and what we call our focus areas, where we really got to change the culture in those particular regions
   0.00  1 That's a big improvement since 2016 where we had 16 fatalities
  -0.50  0 But we -- it's the first year without a multiple fatality incident
   0.00  1 The one area we did have a lot of success is African copper, where we only had 1 fatality in 2017, which is the lowest in history in one of these focus asset regions
   0.11  0 So that gives you an idea where we sit overall, our position of the company, and Steve will take you through more financial details
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.00  1 In terms of that improving momentum and trajectory in Glencore, the $14.8 billion of EBITDA, it's quite interesting just to look at it in the 2 halves as well as we had during the year
   0.00  1 So you can already see that trajectory in terms of margins, in terms of volumes, in terms of marketing performance, we're on the right track
   0.11  0 It's been a while since we've had a 3 in front of that number as well as the EBIT side, notwithstanding that we sold 50% of the agricultural business effective 1 December 2016
   0.00  1 So the sort of product's [ facing ] 3%, we just converted it and also like-for-like to show you that there's been underlying, at least in the metals and the energy side, we've seen some decent growth
   0.00  1 You've got very big-scale global franchises within that business across copper, across zinc, across aluminum, across nickel, increasingly iron ore, you've got the cobalt, you've got ferroalloys, you've got manganese
  -0.09  0 There's many facets of that particular business, some of which have been sort of contradicting at levels not seen in recent periods of time
   0.00  1 So good performances generally across the board
   0.00  1 Energy, also solid performances across both coal and oil, with meaningful contributions in that close to $1 billion performance
   0.00  1 This year, if you look through the marketing attributes, you can see some good volume growth: copper, 14% up; zinc, 40% up; ferroalloys, 14%; and on the crude oil side, we saw 33% increase
   0.00  1 Agricultural side, it's not particularly material in the overall scheme of things, but just to sort of shine a little bit of a light on it, given the market dynamics and the general challenging environment, at the cash generation aspects of this business, at an EBITDA level, you actually saw year-on-year improvement
   0.00 -1 So at the EBIT level, you can see that contraction of 26% because as part of the accounting for that 50% retention of that stake we had in December 2016, we effectively had to remeasure the historical base of the business to the same entry price that the Canadians bought in that business
  -0.09  0 So we have got an artificial extra depreciation charge noncash that's coming through like-for-like in the Marketing side
   0.00  1 But on an EBITDA level, we've actually seen a 7%, which is quite pleasing in the context of that business as well
  -0.03  0 We've said production volume growth, we've seen that come through, as I've said on the previous slide; tighter physical market conditions, we've seen that in many commodities; deployment of additional working capital, I'll show you a little bit of a slide and talk a little about RMI and higher interest rates, which is starting to come through in terms of some tightening cycles
  -0.03  1 And this is a business that has consistently produced very high returns on equity, continues to do so, notwithstanding sort of discussions and debates around at some point barriers to entry, when do people want to come and grab that sort of -- I think we've created quite a unique franchise around high barriers to entry and ability to generate consistently high returns on equity in that business
   0.00  1 As Ivan said, we're up 60% to $11.5 billion
   0.00  1 As you would expect, given the scale and franchises we have, particularly in coal and some of the bigger metal businesses, that's where we've seen increases on that particular side
   0.00  1 So clearly, higher commodity prices is the primary driver
   0.06  0 And we are a big consumer and procurer of the likes of diesel and explosives, and general CPI is going to work its way through the system, cost of construction materials, steel, developing projects, if you like as well
   0.00  1 Very strong EBITDA margins
   0.17  0 Of course, there's highs and lows, depending on the structure of those markets
   0.00  1 We've got copper and zinc at higher levels
   0.00 -1 And of course, prices has had a big factor
   0.00 -1 So that clearly is going to have a volume impact and the associated cost impacts
   0.00  1 But you can see on a unit performance, it's still being very solid as we work our way through the system
  -0.06  1 We've also got material volume growth in cobalt, clearly, up 42% this year; 27% to 39%, given the pricing environment there, that's quite a material catalyst; that's primarily Katanga, 11,000, a little bit over at Mutanda and some of the other operations as well
   0.00  1 And coal itself, if we look second from the bottom, up around 11%, from 120 to 134
   0.06  0 Longer term, which will also feature into some of the modeling and thinking, so you've got more the 2017 to 2020 production outlook at the bottom right, you can see copper, 25%; cobalt, 133%; zinc, 19%; lead, 25%; nickel, 30%; ferrochrome, 6%; coal, 14%; and oil, 39%
  -0.20  1 So quite material volume growth across all the commodities
   0.00 -1 That's a factor
   0.00  1 So copper is -- was sort of steady year-on-year, clearly helped us
   0.00  1 Katanga, of course, through volume and others, is a factor; byproducts is helping there
   0.00  1 Clearly, there, you've seen quite big strength in rand, which is sort of a double-edged sword there
   0.11  0 And zinc continues to power along, byproducts is a big factor there; lead and the various precious metal streams as well
   0.00  1 Obviously, from a financial perspective, a nice slide to look at
   0.00  1 And presiding over, my day job is getting very easy in this company, as you can see, very conservative capital structure, high liquidity levels, manageable maturity profiles, no debt maturing in terms of maturities more than about $3 billion
  -0.17  0 I would suspect these   ratios would -- and trajectory and financial policies would be rerunning the numbers in the next month or so post the thing
   0.00  1 Copper was up 30% during the year, start to finish
   0.20  0 Zinc, 30%; cobalt, 130%; aluminum, 32%; nickel, 28%; lead, 24%; oil, about 25%
   0.00  1 RMI itself was up 30% during the year
   0.00  1 So there's a very strong correlation between pricing and where we ended up the year
   0.15  0 It was around $1.5 billion, which we would attribute to deploying some inventory funding around some attractive risk- adjusted opportunities that invariably happen in markets also from time to time
   0.06  0 Some of the timing can also equally present themselves during a 31st of December period when you've got the industry itself is looking to do a little bit of housekeeping and you find some loose tonnes, and there's clearly an opportunity temporarily to go in there
   0.00  1 The returns on equity from a Glencore business in terms of our core competencies, take that inventory, fund it for a few months and eventually generate some meaningful EBIT
   0.00  1 There was some of this clearly contributing to that good marketing performance, a $3 billion performance we were setting at the beginning of December and still sort of talking towards a $2.8 billion
   0.00 -1 So these are the factors we have out, that's a natural consequence
   0.09  0 Even as we look towards -- this was a particular point at the end of December, as we closed at the end of January, we'd already reduced RMI by about $1.5 billion or so just from that 1 month really as we rolled out some of these opportunities that were there at the end of the year
   0.00  1 We've also had to put $300 million into capital raising that [ they've done ], so we're still the proud holder of about 7% of Yancoal as well, which is nicely in the money at the moment
   0.00  1 And our net debt, $4.8 billion of the free cash flow generation, aside from those few things we've done, has moved towards debt reduction, getting us down to the lower end of that $10 billion to $16 billion range
   0.00  1 But irrespective of that, the numbers are just going to be big by virtue of applying the $1 billion and 25% of industrial free cash flow, that would be a catalyst to potentially materially increase the payout ratios beyond what they've been
   0.00  1 And already now, it went from 25% to this 36%, the potential would be to materially increase
  -0.14  0 There's no upper limit here in terms of we've seen other ones, say, 40% to 60%, or no more than 50%, whatever, could be 100%
   0.06  0 So we've got all the equity cash flows, bottom right, $7.7 billion, and it just flows itself around the circle as we've -- which is translated into those improved graphs around the debt trajectory, debt coverage ratios
   0.00 -1 So it's still a relatively low economic participation
   0.08  0 So despite only putting $730-odd million towards the purchase of those shares, we've had to take in financially under IFRS $4.6 billion of property, plant and equipment, consolidate the whole lot
  -0.07  0 Through the course of 2018, our current intention is, yes, we've got to IFRS consolidate, but we'll disaggregate that and present this business as if it's an associate
   0.00  1 In fact, Volcan's -- it's a zinc business at the moment, and so that's generating a lot of cash
   0.25  0 At the moment, we're clearly integrating
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.00  1 It's very compelling going forward
   0.00  1 We believe we're in the right commodities
  -0.17  0 We're the most exposed to mid- or late-cycle commodities, and it's clear that's the area we're moving into
  -0.07  0 So we're going into the mid-cycle commodities, copper, zinc, nickel, aluminum; and the late-cycle commodities, cobalt, thermal coal, agricultural products
   0.00  1 We don't have the PGMs and diamonds, but we definitely have a compelling commodity mix
   0.06  0 We all know that demand for copper is going to go up, with some copper market today run about 23 million tonnes, if we get 2%, 3% growth around the world, depends on what happens in China, but you're talking about another 500,000 tonnes, 600,000 tonnes of copper is required per year
   0.00 -1 If you look at the supply, we all know there's been a massive underinvestment in new mines in copper
   0.00 -1 But besides that, there's been a total underinvestment in new copper mines
   0.00  1 And if demand does grow to 500,000 tonnes, it will be an interesting outcome there
   0.00  1 Cobalt is clearly electric vehicle story
   0.00  1 We've seen the investments of motor car companies are making in electric vehicles, and they will need battery supply, so the demand for electric vehicle is strong
   0.00  1 So we know the demand for cobalt and this is an alternative method of making batteries will be strong, and the supply is relatively constrained
   0.00  1 Zinc, demand is increasing in emerging markets
   0.00 -1 We know that for galvanizing, and there's been an underinvestment in new zinc mines
   0.00 -1 The growth that we were expecting in China did not occur because of the environmental restrictions taking place at the zinc mines in China
   0.00  1 And the demand grows once again
   0.00 -1 The commodity, we believe, there are supplier restraints
   1.00  0   Lead
   0.00 -1 And once again, mainly also a byproduct of the zinc mines, underinvestments, and once again the environmental restrictions which are occurring in China
  -0.11  0 Nickel demand, once again, electric vehicle, batteries, critical alloy -- it's a critical alloy, austenitic stainless steel growth, et cetera, that's occurring in the year -- in the world
   0.00 -1 And we believe there's going to be an undersupply once again during this year
   0.00 -1 And we're going to have to reduce the stockpiles around the world in order to feed the demand for nickel that's occurring around in the market
   0.00 -1 So once again, undersupply there
   0.00  1 Demand continues to grow in emerging markets
   0.00 -1 And once again, underinvestment in supply, you don't see new coal mines being built around the world
  -0.06  1 However, in volume terms, in metric tonnes, it is growing; but in heating value, in fact, there's no growth because we're getting decline in calorific value being mined from these various mines
   0.00  1 So looks very good
   0.00 -1 Also, we see what's happening in China where they did restrict demand of coal being produced because of the pricing
   0.00  1 So looking pretty strong in thermal coal
   0.00  1 The business of Glencore, once again, resilient and proven cash-generative business
   0.00  1 We are today, and you saw the numbers, Steve showed the production numbers going forward, whereby copper will grow to 1.6 million tonnes; coal, 134 million tonnes; cobalt, 65,000 tonnes
  -0.18  1 And as I said before, these commodities have persistent industry supply challenges and robust underlying demand, which therefore deems well for the company
   0.00  1 We have sustainable low costs
   0.00  1 And we're the byproduct creators, so we have low cost -- the lowest -- I believe the lowest cost in most of those commodities produced in the world
   0.00  1 It's been proven that it is a high return on equity type business
   0.00  1 It's unique
   0.17  0 We know what is happening in the markets, and that gives us a lot of insight
   0.00  1 And once again, it's resilient
  -0.25  1 And as we said, the $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion EBIT to the business, and that is very   defensive
  -0.14  1 As you can see in the slide on the right, it's resilient even when commodity prices fall, drop
   0.00  1 It has been resilient and it is not linear to commodity prices
   0.00  1 [ Post that out to ] 2019, as Steve indicated, with higher production figures that are occurring in 2019, that will even be higher than that level
   0.00  1 So very cash-generative at current commodity prices and very high EBITDA going forward
  -0.17  0 And the Tier 1 commodity outlook is underpinned by this limited supply
   0.00  1 And we believe the demand is there, the demand in China continues to grow, once the Chinese consume close to 50% of most of the commodities that we produce
   0.00  1 What's happening in the electric vehicle industry, we're the best place for that out of all the large caps
   0.00  1 Cash-generative unique business model, as I said, Tier 1 Industrial assets, very low-cost producing, long- term life; Marketing, highly generative; and once again, emphasize how the EBITDA will look during this year at these current commodity prices and the free cash flow that is going to generate
   0.00  1 We've always said we're able and willing and we wish to grow our business
   0.00 -1 And eventually, when you do get it, you may have overspent it and it doesn't generate the returns you want
  -0.10  0 We've always said, we agree we -- I will cut back capacity, we think we're over supplying a market and we'll do the same on the other side, and we'll reactivate the idle capacity, as you saw we did with our zinc operations, when we believe it's appropriate
   0.11  0 We always look at different synergies we can have with next door neighbors, as you saw with Hunter Valley, the opportunity occurred last year to purchase the Hunter Valley Operations
   0.33  0 So we're always looking for those opportunities
   0.00  1 And if you look at our track record on investments, it's been pretty good in the past
   0.00  1 And they're very good cash generative assets we added to the group during 2017
   0.00  1 And as you saw, this year, we delivered a 36% free cash flow
   0.08  0 And as Steve says, later on in the year, we'll have a look at the balance sheet, and we'll see what we do, whether we increase it, or, what type of investment opportunities present themselves
   0.00  1 So I think that gives you a summary how the group operates and how we intend looking at the future, looking very strong with the right commodities; very low-cost production, as you saw on the cost   production slides; growth going forward in those commodities
   0.00  1 So I think we're well placed for the future
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -1.00  0 Two questions
  -0.08  0 Hopefully, it will be consultation and the mining industry and the DRC has got together to discuss this with him, and it's the wait-and-see situation, so we don't know much more than you hear in the press as well
  -0.11  0  I don't think anything into '18 now, Liam, because you've got some lag times on these sort of things as well
  -0.33  0 Two more questions on DRC, if I may
   0.17  0 One, if you could provide some color on how the ramp-up of Katanga is progressing
  -0.17  0 So that we're obviously limited to what we can say beyond their own reporting requirements
  -0.33  0 We haven't seen disruptions over there
   0.00 -1 So I'm surprised with Volcan, with the HVO operations that you're not raising the guidance band on those marketing earnings
   0.00  1 Let's get the debt down to the $10 billion, that's the catalyst to lift it
   0.00  1 I think we're as good as stewards of that cash for now in terms of internal holding on
   0.00  1 Let's see the sort of opportunity set as well around what happens, if that's a more benign environment, which it is, difficult to buy assets today that meet one's return and you do generate that sort of cash flow, then the top up is, as I said, well and truly alive in the August period
   0.14  0 That gap is now, we've gone through $10 billion, let's lock in the positioning around the structure
   0.00  1 That gap has the potential to significantly narrow
   0.08  0 Why wouldn't we -- yes, look, let's see, we've got the Volcan, we've got the Hunter Valley, of course they would present opportunities, especially, Hunter Valley, the blending opportunities, et cetera, with our own tonnes to party tonnes, et cetera
  -0.18  0 I'm sure there will be a question on that at some point, so I'm just preempting that sort of questions going to come at some point
  -0.25  0 The second question on cobalt debottlenecking
  -0.07  0 Of course, a moving situation there, but what would you say is an acceptable -- would be an acceptable outcome for the mining court?  Yes, firstly, the last question, I cannot comment what's acceptable
  -0.25  0 The other question, I think, was to you on the ROE, Steve, [ I can't ]..
   0.00  1 So certainly 30% plus comfortably on the marketing ROE this year
  -0.12  0 First you've surveyed the field out there, you see clearly no Greenfield, as you pointed out, but quite a bit of Brownfield, including your own
  -0.17  0 They definitely -- with China -- with the CapEx in China, certainly smelting in the West is not as bad as it used to be
   0.00  1 So smelting is good
  -0.25  0 But going forward, let's see what happens with the shutdowns and how many smelters do really shut down in China
   0.25  0 Yes, we have some Brownfield opportunities, not -- they're good
   0.09  0 I wouldn't -- I don't believe the industry has massive Brownfield opportunities, I don't know where you see them, Menno
   0.25  0 So there's not many Brownfield opportunities in these commodities
   0.20  0 But I don't see those Brownfield opportunities that you talk about in these commodities
  -0.33  0 Yes, the third part of the question..
   0.17  0 Now if you had told me this that the beginning of the year in 2017, would those opportunities come, were they there, we don't know
   0.12  0 The opportunity occurred was Volcan because of our relationship with the family, et cetera, that came
   0.33  0 We did a deal with the Chinese, eventually, after they were the winning bidder
   0.17  0 Chevron opportunity came, you didn't know
  -0.25  0 And then we'd have to assess it and see where the difficulties would occur
  -0.40  0 When we did buy Xstrata because of antitrust, the Chinese did -- we did have to dispose of Las Bambas..
   0.00  1 We've got, I think, we have room to grow, put it that way
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions
   0.12  0 Yes, we do have agreements in place and if the new mining code changes the existing agreement which is in place, there is an opportunity to go to court
   0.00  1  And ambitions in ag [ business ]
   0.00 -1  Ambitions in ag, sorry I forgot that, trying to avoid that one
   0.00  1 We have clearly said, we would like to grow in the states
   0.00 -1 The ag business is in a poor state
   0.17  0 And we'll wait for opportunities, like the rest of our business, if and when they come
  -0.33  0 Just 3 questions, 2 related to costs
  -0.50  0 And then the third question is just on South Africa
   0.17  0 If things do develop in a positive direction, could you see yourselves reinvesting back in the country?  Steve can talk about cost
  -0.25  0 I'll take the first part of the question, South Africa
    nan  1 It should be good for the   country
   0.00 -1 Unfortunately, it's going to affect your cost because the rand has got stronger
   0.00  1 So it does bode well for the country going forward
   0.00 -1 I would say all the cost pressures that we're seeing is generally those passive currency and commodity flow-through which is having that inflationary side in terms of dollar costs
  -0.17  0 Some of your agreements are linked to sort of CPI adjustments that might be in contract, things that might be in some of the wage agreements that you might have as well
   0.00 -1 So I would -- nothing particularly notable
  -0.11  0 I have a question about your EBITDA waterfall chart on Exhibit 9 and unit cost on Exhibit 10
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.12  0 Second question on the cycle, maybe kind of related to what Jason was asking about projects
  -0.43  0 Or is that not something that we really should be worrying about this point yet?    Okay, quite detailed questions there, Chris
  -0.14  0 We probably need a few hours to run through, if we want to get into the weeds of some of those questions
   0.00 -1 I mean 2017 was a period where we were still adjusting volumes to being in sort of containment and supply constraints around sort of looking to sort of accelerate markets getting to a more sort of tighter period
   0.06 -1 So the volume impact we have there was power issues down in Zambia, which that operation then lowered output for a while, which in turn had the flow on effect of reducing asset supply across the border into Mutanda, which then impacted some cobalt and some copper production down there
  -0.12  0 So you've seen quite a material impact through that supply chain come through
   0.00 -1 Some weather-related issues in Colombia, a few sort of gray things
   0.00 -1 What we've had to do also in Australia during periods we have some strike action like you're bringing in the temporary workforces and contractors and alike
  -0.11  0 Arguably, you can push that revenue linked over into as a net cost impact as opposed to some sort of headwind that you have
  -0.12  0 I would also argue that, that's in the sort of that good consequential cyclical passive inputs that come through
   0.08  0 The cobalts, the zincs, the leads, all these products and zinc and alike is going to come through price and not through the -- in terms of unit cost that's how the industry tends to report these things
  -0.14  0    And then on the other part of your question, the growth and higher interest rates
   0.00  1 So high interest rate naturally proves inflation that we're going to high commodity prices, so that's the upside
  -0.05  0 If you believe what we've said earlier, where the demand growth copper going, 500,000 tonnes, et cetera, and what's going to happen in a lot of the commodities and the decline rates in a lot of the existing assets today, we're going to have to Greenfields some say
   0.25  0 That there are a few Brownfield opportunities, which we discussed earlier but not many
   0.00 -1 Thermal coal, Indonesia is tougher, as I said earlier
   0.00 -1 So it's getting tougher
   0.25  0 We're not going to the easy countries, you're not going Australia, you're not even going South Africa
   0.00 -1 You're going to the tough -- you're going to Russia
   0.50  0 We don't have the same stability that you get in the better countries
   0.00 -1 So it's going to get tougher
   0.08  0 And also the way what we do inside that number as well, we effectively treat the, because we're a small play in the Coking coal market, it's almost treated like a byproduct for the purpose of that buildup in EBITDA
  -0.06  0 So it is a complicated overall buildup of cash generation given qualities and exposures and blends and at time, and it just reflects the byproduct of coking and the different quality at the particular point in time
   0.08  0 And we'd look to -- that's why we do try and guide in that area as well we sort of can because it's not easy that's -- I mean, we obviously model it
    nan  1 We have all the drivers to be able to do that
   0.00 -1 It is the hardest one for you guys at the room and the marketplace itself to be able to at any point in time appreciating exactly what's happening across all the different blends and realizations
  -0.50  0 And some of it is lagging because you got pricing that might be quarterly
  -0.03  0  And there's so many different brands of coal within the group, even just within South Africa, if you talk API4, that's a guideline, but then we got many different coals which don't trade at API4 and the discount to API4 and you're selling today into India 4,800 kilocal coal as opposed to API4, which is a much higher kilocal coal, so the discounts and the discounts vary from time to time
   0.00 -1 So that's the tough one to sort of get to the right number
  -0.09  0 There's quite a lot of supply of fields, more than we've seen for the last 5, 10 years sort of coming into the market sort of outside China
  -0.25  0 Now the question is you talk about we've gone up
   0.00 -1 What we're adding this year, okay, besides other things a 90,000 tonnes roundabout there, and we'll be cautious on the   balance
  -0.17  0 You do have the one mine shutting in South Africa and the other mine coming on from Mutanda that will add a bit, but nothing big, because you do have the one shutting down, what's it called, Johannesburg
   0.00 -1 It, in fact, decreased
  -0.14  0 Talk to our zinc guys, it's hard one to call anything that happens in Chinese more difficult call, but we don't see it right now
  -0.67  0  Any more questions?  One quick question on hedging
   0.11  0 But we do have a lot of index sales and the opportune time may come where you may want to lock out some of those index sales, and then you will have your mark-to-market on hedge
   0.00  1 Thanks a lot
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

   0.00  1                                           Welcome, everyone
   0.33  0 So the opportunity to meet both Paul and Mark as well as Kevin and me after the presentation
   0.00  1 And as you'll see, we delivered strong organic growth
   0.00  1 We also exceeded GBP 1 billion in revenue for the first time in our history, and again, you'll see widespread growth across our sectors and across our regions
   0.08  0 But it would be remiss of me not to thank Kevin for the tremendous contribution that he's made to the group over a 30-year period and 20 years of that 30-year period as the group Finance Director
   0.00  1 He's been extremely helpful to me as CEO as I started out and to many other people in the group giving them wise counsel and really learning from Kevin about making sensible decisions to keep the group on track and keep growing
   0.00  1  Thanks for that
   0.00  1 So we've seen widespread growth, and I'll talk through some of the highlights
   0.00  1   You can see strong growth over that 5-year period
   0.00  1 Over the past 30 years, we've delivered compound revenue growth of 11%
   0.00  1 Compound revenue growth, so 11% with growth in all but 2 years
   0.00  1 So as you can see, very strong organic constant currency revenue growth, 10%, well ahead of our 5% KPI, in line with expectations
   0.00  1 The contribution from this year's and last year's acquisitions added 2% to give 12% revenue growth together with the organic constant currency growth
  -0.12  0 Although there was a lot of currency volatility through the year, currency translation impact was actually neutral for the year as a whole
   0.00  1 All 4 sectors delivered revenue growth, both headline and organic constant currency
  -0.10  1 The headline increase you can see here in the second half of 10% had a bigger contribution from acquisitions, but as I noted, had the negative impact of currency
   0.00  1 And then you see on the right-hand side of the chart here, strong organic constant currency growth of 9% in the first half and that increased further to 11% in the second half
   0.00  1 So a strong finish to the year
   0.00  1 And we had higher second half revenue growth in Environmental & Analysis and in Medical on an organic constant currency basis in the second half
   0.11  0 Now this is the revenue by destination, so the proportions of revenue on the chart, the growth rates around the outside
   0.00  1 You can see strong revenue growth in all the regions
   0.20  0 remains our largest sales destination, 35% of total revenue, up 8%
   0.00  1 was up 12% with growth in all 4 sectors and there was also growth in all 4 sectors in mainland Europe and in Asia
   0.00  1 Mainland Europe, up 13%; Asia-Pacific, up 15%
   0.00  1 was up 16% and revenue within those territories up 10%
   0.00  1 And again, you can see really good growth across all the regions
   0.00  1 grew by 9%
  -0.33  0 You may recall that the U.S.A
   0.00  1 was up 6% in the first half and that accelerated growth in the second half to 12%
   0.00  1 Environmental & Analysis, really strong second half in the U.S
   0.00  1 grew by 9%, pretty even growth across the year
   0.00  1 Mainland Europe, up 8%, similar growth to that in the first half
   0.00  1 We had France down, but Germany, Holland, Scandinavia all nicely up
   0.00  1 And Asia-Pacific grew well throughout the year
    nan  1 It was up 14%
   0.00  1 China was up 18% with growth in all 4 sectors
   0.00  1 And the other regions were up
   0.00  1 We were strong in Near and Middle East, otherwise good in Canada, which we count in the other set territories, mixed across much of South and Central America, but actually a strong performance in Brazil
   0.20  0 So let's switch to the profit performance
   0.10  0 So on that basis, there was a 1% acquisition profit contribution from the 2016/'17 acquisition of FluxData and the 5 acquisitions that we've made during 2017/'18
   0.12 -1 Now as I said, the revenue contribution from acquisitions was in line with expectations but profitability was a bit lower
  -0.33  0 In part that was to do with the phasing of contracts
   0.00  1 For example, FluxData actually had a really good year, but most of that fell towards the end of the year and that counts within our organic growth rather than part of the acquisition growth
   0.09 -1 And as we said in the past, in the first year of ownership, you often see lower profitability with the transition through to Halma's ownership and also the increased investment that we put in
   0.00  1 We're expecting to see growth from all the acquisitions in 2018-'19 and beyond
   0.20  0 So currency translation impact from profit was neutral
   0.25  0   In this, the first half-second half split of profit
  -0.05  1 Then breaking down that organic constant currency performance, we saw Environmental & Analysis growing strongly through the year, Process Safety growing in the second half, but not as fast as in the first half; solid performance from Infrastructure Safety and Medical, as we expected, recovering to growth in the second half
   0.09  0 So just pulling together strands on currency, as I said, currency translation and neutral impact for the year overall, after 5% benefit in the first half
   0.00 -1 dollar relative to sterling was around 1.35 and that compares to 1.33 average rate in 2017/'18 and if the euro is around 1.13, then if we base on the last year's, the 2017/'18 mix of profits, we probably expect a 1% adverse currency translation impact for the year, bringing more like 2% in the first half and then reversing somewhat in the second half
   0.00  1 Just a reminder that it's Medical and Environmental & Analysis that have the most benefit from a weaker sterling
   0.11  0 There's more information in the appendices to the slide pack, including the impact of 1% changes in currency on the results
   0.00  1 A main driver of that was the high rates of revenue growth and the strong momentum in Q4, although debtor days have actually remained in line with the previous year
   0.00 -1 We've also seen higher inventory in some of our companies supporting new product introductions
   0.00 -1 At GBP 22 million, CapEx was GBP 2 million below last year
   0.00  1 So our forecast for 2018-'19 is a substantial increase to GBP 34 million of CapEx
  -0.10  0 So that includes that deferred spend but also some other facilities and automation projects, in particular, in Infrastructure Safety that will be going on in this New Year
   0.33  0 The effective tax rate was 19.7%
   0.00 -1 So that's below the 21.5% last year and also below the guidance we gave at the half year of 22.3%
   0.14  0 I think a few reasons for that, mix of profits was a bit different to, say, to the previous year
   0.00 -1 But I think probably one of the biggest factors was the reduced corporate tax rates in the U.S
  -0.12  0 deferred tax assets and liabilities due to those reduced U.S
   0.20  0 So we're expecting for 2018-'19 an effective tax rate of around 20%
  -0.05  0 The pension deficit reduced this year to GBP 54 million from GBP 75 million last year due mainly to company contributions, but also the revision to mortality assumptions based on the latest guidance and that reduces the accounting liabilities
   0.00  1 We're proposing an increase to final dividend of 7%, giving us 7% for the year and, as Andrew said, the 39th consecutive year of 5% or more dividend increases
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet is strong
   0.00  1 R&D investment, up 12%, in line with revenue up to GBP 56 million, 5.2% of revenue
   0.00  1 Return on sales remains high, 19.9% within our 18% to 22% range
   0.00  1 We just -- we continue to make investments for growth whilst maintaining these high returns
   0.00  1 Adjusted earnings per share, up 13%
   0.00  1 And then return on total invested capital, in line with last year, remaining high, well ahead of our weighted average cost of capital and our 12% target
   0.00  1 So overall, a really good year
   0.00  1 I'll leave you in Marc's very capable hands for the future, but of course, I'll be watching with a lot of interest over the coming years
   0.17  0 So here's an overview of the sector performances, revenue and profit
   0.20  0 So if we have a look at the organic constant currency growth figures, you get a better sense of the underlying progress
   0.00 -1 Just to put that into context, at the end of H1, the Medical sector had a 6% organic constant currency decline in profit
   0.00  1 I'm going to talk a little bit about the digital investment in a moment, but also our R&D spend was up by 12% at the group level during the year just underpinning the fact that the companies are still investing, growing their core
   0.00  1 So you can see growth in all of our industries, all of our end markets, very much a similar pattern to what you'll see in the sector
   0.00  1 Energy was up nicely
  -0.04  1 The obvious point is the benefit of diversity of the group in the markets we serve but also the value of those long-term growth drivers, so increasing health and safety regulation, increasing demand for health care, and life-critical resources you see playing out when you look at the widespread growth across all of these end markets
   0.00  1 So certainly, I'm very pleased with both the diversity we've got and the growth that we're seeing across the Group
   0.00  1 As Kevin said, performed well in line with expectations
   0.00  1 So here, our revenue is up by 11% to GBP 185 million
   0.00  1 That's all organic growth
   0.00 -1 Return on sales slightly lower than last year 23.5% this year compared to 24.1% last year
   0.00  1 At the business unit level, the Pipeline Management, Safety Interlock and Pressure Management businesses all performed strongly
   0.00 -1 That's a big market for our Gas Sensor business which I mentioned earlier had a slightly lower rate of growth than elsewhere in the sector
   0.00  1 But overall, good performance in Process Safety
   0.00  1 Revenue is up by 11% to GBP 349 million, which is 8% organic constant currency growth
   0.00  1 That's a really strong 10% organic constant currency rate of growth
   0.14  0 And on both revenue and profit, we had a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 1% impact from currency
   0.00  1 R&D investment up by 13% above the rate of revenue growth
  -0.20  1 Strong performances in fire and also in people and vehicle movement businesses
   0.00  1 So again, growth across each of the business sectors
   0.00  1 You can see growth in all the regions except the U.S.A
   0.00 -1 was actually down 5% organic constant currency
   0.00  1 On the other hand, strong double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific and other regions
   0.00  1 And with the acquisitions of Setco for our Elevator Safety business from Spain; and Argus, the Italian fire business, we expect that position in Mainland Europe to be further strengthened by those acquisitions
   0.00  1 finally with 8% organic constant currency growth
   0.00  1 Revenue up by 9% to GBP 284 million
   0.00  1 That's 7% organic constant currency revenue   growth
   0.12 -1 And then we've got profit just ahead of last year at GBP 67 million, slightly lower than last year in organic constant currency terms with a 1% benefit from acquisitions and there's a very small currency impact overall for the year in this sector
   0.00 -1 Return on sales actually in this sector were down by 2 percentage points from 25.6% to 23.6%
   0.00  1 So we just saw higher growth in our lower gross margin businesses compared to our higher gross margin businesses
   0.00  1 All the business sectors grew revenue
   0.00  1 And then we saw growth in all the major regions, including good organic constant currency growth in the U.S.A., which is our dominant market
   0.00  1 Asia-Pacific also grew
   0.00  1 Strong growth in other regions, and other regions, bear in mind, now includes the contribution from Cardios, which is the blood pressure monitoring business we acquired from Brazil
   0.00  1 And finally, the outstanding performer of the year, Environmental & Analysis
   0.00  1 And again, as I said at the beginning, even excluding the benefit of the reorganization of Pixelteq last year, both the cost and the disruption caused by that, you can see very strong underlying growth here
   0.00  1 Revenue up 18% to GBP 259 million
   0.00  1 That's 28% organic constant currency growth with a 6% acquisition contribution
   0.00 -1 There was some currency impacts here, very little on revenue, but a 2% adverse impact on the profit figures from currency movements
   0.00  1 Return on sales continues to rise
   0.00  1 It's now moved up from 19% to 21.2% this year, and that's against the backdrop again of increasing investment
   0.00  1 The Photonics businesses, the Water businesses, the Environmental Monitoring businesses all contributing strongly to this growth as well as the Mini-Cam acquisition
   0.00  1 Again, that's doing well
   0.25  0 And then finally, looking at the revenue by destination
   0.00  1 As of the half year, we saw good and strong organic growth in all the regions except the relatively small other region, which is around 6% of the sector
   0.00  1 saw strong organic growth
   0.00  1 Good contributions here from our Photonics businesses, and our Water businesses helped the U.K
   0.00  1 deliver very strong performance, up 22% organically
   0.00  1 And then finally, Asia-Pacific continues to thrive
   0.00  1 So an outstanding year, widespread growth, a good size acquisition
   0.06  0 I also talked about the executive board changes that I've made in December, reducing the number of sector chief executives from 4 down to 2 and also the appointment of our first ever Chief Innovation and Digital Officer to help drive through some of the new things we want to do
   0.00  1 And for us it's growing a safer, cleaner, healthier future every day
   0.00  1 So this drives our efforts
   0.00  1 Convergence growth and Edge growth
   0.00  1 Convergence growth is combining the assets or capabilities of 2 or more businesses to create a new business model or create a new value proposition for the market
   0.08  0 And this new business could sit inside an existing Halma company or it could be within the group as a separate stand-alone business depending on how we see the best way to explore it
  -0.08  1 And I think if you look at the diversity of our group, if you look at the diversity of our technologies and our markets, clearly, there are lots of opportunities for combining those together to explore new ways of growing
   0.00  1 And then we have Edge growth
   0.00  1 And Edge growth is purely focused on digital disruption and just making sure that we are plugged into those innovation hotspots around the world to understand what's going on, to accelerate our own growth, but also understand how we're going to continue to be competitive as we look forward, as we grow
  -0.07  0 So for example, rather than seeking to become experts ourselves in artificial intelligence or robotics, making sure we partner up with the right external people and bringing their capabilities into our business
   0.50  0 We then have what we call the growth enablers
   0.00  1 These are the things that we invest in to help our companies grow faster and grow for longer
   0.10  0 So things like innovation, talent, acquisitions, finance, international expansion, you'll all be very familiar with me talking about these
   0.33  0 And also, then we need to measure our achievement in new ways
   0.00  1   In talent and culture, we're bringing new digital capabilities into the business
   0.20  0 I mentioned our Chief Innovation and Digital Officer
   0.29  0 So for example, they learn how convergence growth can work, how they can collaborate and cooperate better
   0.11  0 It's much easier to do that when you've just got those 2 sector [ CEOs ] overseeing half of the group each
   0.67  0 For innovation, we now call innovation network
  -0.12  1 It's just recognizing that with the diversity that we've got, diversity helps innovation
   0.00  1 And then international expansion, getting our local teams in their local markets, whether it's in China, India or elsewhere in the world to have -- develop more market intelligence and think about the viability of the different technologies that are really going to play best in their markets because it's not going to be the same solution for each market
   0.00  1 And then we've got our 2 new ones: strategic communications and digital growth engine
   0.00  1 So we have rebuilt and upscaled our communications team
   0.25  0 And a great example of this is what we call the Halma hub
   0.33  0 So this is our in-house portal, which initially we were thinking we were just going to use to improve innovation
   0.06  0 And so the big thing for me is we're moving that innovation network from the top layer of the organization or just to sit at say the top 250, 300 people much deeper into our business so that people lower down the business can now communicate directly with each other across companies
   0.07  0 So it puts out a question, anyone know how to -- any great tools for improving project management, and then we have a series of conversations going on very quickly and ultimately ends up with one of our U.K
   0.08  0 So as we build up the knowledge on this Halma hub, in this case, someone's put in, "Can we find out about collaboration agreements?" And in fact, it was -- we had a U.S
  -0.06  0 Put the question out there, one of our divisional chief executives actually from the Environmental & Analysis sector came back with, "Well, I know one of my company's got a lot of experience in this, Ocean   Optics
   0.14  0 So just some very simple examples, where lower down the organization, you're just accelerating the pace of change and the collaboration between the companies
   0.00 -1 Many of our businesses have different challenges when it comes to embracing the digital data connectivity opportunity
   0.12  0 So for some of them, it's about solving the technical barriers to make their products more connected, more data-driven
  -0.17  0 So that's what we're trying to help our companies overcome some of those barriers
   0.06  0 So we've built a small central team who are leading various programs and initiatives, working with the companies across all of those growth engines and across the core growth, the convergence growth and the edge growth
   0.00 -1 It's solving a real customer problem
   0.00  1 And through the program, we help them learn how to be much more agile and also how to validate their ideas with their customers more directly because they have a new digital blood pressure monitoring concept
   0.07  0 So when they look forward now, it's not just that they've got a new concept that they're developing, but they now understand exactly where they need to play in their market and how they're going to win in that market
   0.00  1 The exponential scaling program is helping these businesses look for new applications of their digital platforms
   0.00  1 And I think this one, it will be very interesting to see how this program develops
   0.10  0 So this is a 4-month-long program where we get 2 or more Halma companies to combine assets and resources for a totally new business opportunity
   0.12  0 And in April, the 6 selected businesses, having been through the program, pitched their ideas to the Halma leadership conference in Boston
  -0.07  0 and European businesses in our medical sector who, together with an external artificial intelligence expert, looked at ways in which they could transform the screening of diabetic retinopathy, which is a key cause of blindness in the world
   0.00  1 And this combination of our technology with an external partner's artificial intelligence capability could give us a new way to screen that very, very easily
   0.00  1 It's the newest of our growth engines and this is really to enable our companies to explore disruptive digital growth models within a lean startup environment
   0.08  0 And then finally, we've got the innovation hot spot, which is covering all 3 elements of our growth strategy, and we started our new -- first new partnership here with a business called OurCrowd
   0.29  0 The first thing is the digital growth enablers are complementary to our existing growth enablers
   0.11  0 They're not replacing them, they sit alongside the innovation, the international expansion, the talent development
   0.08  0 And then finally, [ that as ] we go through the year, we will start to review what's working, what's not working and also we'll develop the KPIs which will allow us all to see how we're making progress on these things, but they sit alongside our existing KPIs because our focus continues to be on growing our core business and making sure that, that is successful
   0.00  1 It's been a really good year for the group
   0.00  1 Record results, widespread growth across all our sectors and across our regions, with strong returns, strong cash generation and a further dividend increase
   0.00  1 We've also increased our strategic investment, not just in digital initiatives but also in R&D spend, up by 12%, and we've completed 5 acquisitions
   0.00  1 We've added 2 new elements of growth alongside our core growth
   0.00  1 Our order intake is ahead of revenue and also ahead of the order intake last year
  -0.20  0 I'd now like to open up the meeting to questions
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.17  0 And if you remember back in the first half, it's the broader Fire business
  -0.50  0 for our fire products
  -0.14  0 Almost everything we sell in fire is really focused on the public and commercial buildings
   0.00  1 water, obviously, a good performance this year
   0.00 -1 So a little bit of uncertainty, I would say
   0.00  1 And I think we're all -- have read in the press that the water companies are under a lot of pressure to improve their leakage performance
   0.00  1 Obviously, if you look forward then a year or 2 over the next 5 years, we'd expect a strong performance because the water companies, as I say, are going to be under increasing pressure to increase investments in that
  -0.25  0 I think it was in terms of negotiating contracts..
   0.00 -1 So in other words, the lower gross margin businesses growing faster than the higher gross margin businesses, ultimately, has resulted in some pressure there
   0.00 -1 That see -- that mix seems to be a bigger issue than any widespread sort of pricing issue that we're seeing across the group there -- across the sector there
  -0.17  1 I mean we had 10% organic growth but no real drop through to margin operational gearing
   0.00  1 Going forward, is that more of the strategy, sort of hold the margins at around the 20%, invest more so we should see higher top line growth
   0.00 -1 So I guess we shouldn't expect the margin to a huge amount in 2019
  -0.06  0 So should we change how we see Halma slightly as a higher growth but less of a sort of margin drop-through business?  I would have said that's how it's always been because I think one of the things that's interesting about Halma is that investment mindset
   0.05  0 So I think if you look over the past years, it's kind of what we've been doing, and I think we're going through -- there's a phase now where there's opportunities to increase in the digital areas that Andrew was talking about, and that's led to some of that increased central investment
   0.00  1 I think it's just part of that evolution where we'll combine solid investment with high returns and, as you say, driving the revenue growth coming from that
   0.00  1 I think we're getting a much clearer vision of them and a clear purpose behind certainly compared to where we were 10 years ago
   0.00  1 water, where we're saying, "Okay, what happens this year?" Clearly, I described it as an outstanding performance
   0.00  1 So I think it's unusually -- usually good performance with all those factors going in our favor this year
   0.00 -1 However, execution is the uncertainty
   0.00  1 But there is a sense of, I suppose, increasing momentum across those businesses coming into this year compared to certainly where we were a couple of years ago
   0.08  0 And I think by the end of the first half, we'll all have a better sense of, okay, what is the true underlying growth that we're seeing coming from these businesses
   0.20  0 As Kevin mentioned, he talked about the phrase innovation mindset
   0.00  1 Yes, these businesses are investing to sustain growth
   0.33 -1 They're not being run to boost short in profitability, that's for certain
  -0.15  0 Just interested and I appreciate this is a -- it'd be quite a difficult question, but in terms of where do you think the kind of the oil and gas, because I'm assuming oil and gas in the second half was similarly very good or kind of energy more broadly
  -0.10  0 Kind of where do you think that is versus sort of, I guess, pre oil and gas downturn levels, just trying to think about how much is kind of recovery, how much is just now the growth trajectory for these businesses that we saw kind of before that downturn?  Yes
  -0.11  0 Now today, it's around about 40% of the sector revenue because we deliberately diversified and got more growth from other markets
   0.00  1 onshore business, that's having obviously a positive impact in the last 18 months, the majority of what we sell into oil and gas is late cycle and it's midstream and downstream
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of questions from me
   0.04  0 So if you think of it from the point of view of if I'm running a company, under the old strategy, if I wanted to get some kind of collaboration going formally with another group company in a different sector, I'd have to speak to my Chairman, who would then speak to the sector CEO, who then speaks to the other sector CEO, who then speaks to the other Chairman
   0.14  0 And from a reporting point of view, they're also having much greater direct interaction with me
  -0.17  0 On the M&A -- the M&A pipeline was the second part of your question
  -0.25  0 Quite similar to the half year, really
   0.17  0 I mean, we've made -- continue to make some acquisitions, which is pleasing
   0.00  1 The pipeline, as I said at the outlook statement, is actually pretty good across the 4 sectors
   0.00 -1 If you're buying a good quality company in a good end market like we are looking for, then there's, obviously, pressure on valuations if they go to an auction process
   0.17  0 Having said all of that, as we all know, it doesn't necessarily mean that leads to more deals
   0.00  1 We still got to maintain our discipline, make sure we're buying good companies at sensible prices
   0.11  0 There's a slide in the appendices that sort of set out what we -- yes, what the contribution last year through to and what was achieved and then what we would expect in the next year
   0.08  0 There's a lot of talk from the OEMs about going digital and selling digital services to the customers by installing the box and monitoring and getting better at running it
  -0.07  0 So I'll just remind you, an infrastructure sense is almost every business there, about 1/3 of what it's selling is going to the OEM manufacturers and then 2/3 of what we're selling is going to local elevator, fire, door safety businesses
   0.00 -1 So we don't see that changing hugely at the moment
   0.00  1 They see us as the kind of people that can help them get to where they need to get to faster as well
  -0.09  0 So I think all else being equal, unless there's some other change, I think it's just -- it's a gradual change getting towards the -- meeting the deficit
  -1.00  0  Just 2 quick questions
   0.12  0 So very much that sets where the emphasis, if you like, is very much in terms of the way people get rewarded, the way their performance is measured
   0.00  1 And we're very keen to ensure that with the new KPIs that we develop, again, you don't get that out of balance
  -0.11  0 It's that way around, I would say, at the moment rather than me worrying too much that we're going to spend all our time on that and not looking after the core
   0.12  0 And again, if you think about what we got there, not every business is meant to be completely plugged into all of those growth enablers
   0.17  0 The phrase I've used at the leadership conference, [ those ] -- this is a menu
   0.33  0 Those growth enablers are a menu
   0.10  0 So it's very much trying to create that pull system rather than the push system, but that's a great point
   0.25  0 But yes, it's been a pleasure to work with you
   0.00  1    Thank you

---FILE: Hammerson plc.txt

   0.00  1 Well, good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 We continue to deliver on our strong track record of growth with earnings per share up 6.5%, dividend per share up 6.3% and NAV per share up 5%
   0.17  0 It's also worth pointing out our retail venues attract some 430 million shopper visits per year
   0.00  1 And again, premium outlets continued to generate stellar sales growth up over 9%
   0.00  1 You can see that this is illustrated in our track record for both earnings and valuation performance, which is driven by ongoing strong demand for a well-managed space
   0.00  1 It's worth noting that through a mixed environment, we've grown earnings by close to 50% over the period shown on the chart
   0.00  1 And over the past 12 months, we've also continued to deliver dividend growth in line with our previous consistent performance of 6% to 8%
  -0.14  0 We are present in 13 countries around Europe, but we are concentrating on faster growth catchments as opposed to countries
   0.00  1   The proposed acquisition of Intu absolutely delivers against our 3 core strategic principles, and that will increase the future -- and will increase the future performance of the enlarged group
   0.09  0 Highlighted here, we have identified different retail categories who seek to utilize the best physical space for maximum effect
   0.09 -1 Brands like Prada and Gucci will only work with the best outlet operators to distribute their surplus stock and protect their valuable brand equity
  -0.08  0 And finally, shown in purple on the right, pure-play online retailers have recognized that there are limitations to online retailing
   0.00  1 Online retailers are being driven to take physical space in the best locations to enrich their brand value and to often offer consumers fun, which is hard to do from the screen
   0.11  0 Brands want to work with trusted channels and destinations like ours provide just that: A branded venue that shoppers trust
   0.06  0 The quality bandings are based on metrics, including strength of catchment, type of anchor stores, share of leisure, vacancy rate, dwell time, and so on
   0.05  0 Now adding Hammerson's centress to the chart, shown here in blue, you'd rightly expect our portfolio to be heavily weighted towards the superior end, as we expertly manage our centress to ensure they exceed the vast majority of the market
  -0.09  0 As we've announced, we have identified GBP 2 billion of assets to dispose of, roughly 10% of the combined business, over the medium term
   0.00  1 Our disposal program enhances the overall performance of the Group
   0.00  1 And as you can see from the chart on the left, we have generated at GBP 1.2 billion of proceeds over the past 3 years, broadly in line with book value, which demonstrates our skill of execution and represents well over 10% of our current portfolio
  -0.12  0 As you can see from the chart on the right, there is a diverse mix of buyers for well-invested and well-managed real estate
  -0.11  0 There remains clear investment demand, and we've already disposed of just under GBP 100 million worth of properties so far in 2018
   0.00  1 If you fast- forward to 2021 and following additional disposals and reinvestment, the makeup of the portfolio is further enhanced with 72% of assets in our high-growth categories with an increased portfolio waiting in Europe and premium outlets
   0.00  1 As you saw earlier, we are acquiring a high-quality portfolio, and this was illustrated last week when Intu posted a good set of numbers
   0.00  1 And we see strong potential in the assets in the development pipeline and the potential to create the best retail team in the sector
   0.00  1  Well, thank you, David, and good morning, everybody
  -0.04  0 I got 5 areas to cover in this finance section: A review of the 2017 performance, including net rental income trends; analysis of cost-income ratios; a new debt facility to reduce interest expenses; our 2018 disposal plans; and the discussion of drivers of future earnings per share growth
   0.00  1 Net rental income at GBP 370.4 million is up 6.9% on 2016 due to rents from recent developments, acquisitions and a good underlying like-for-like increase
   0.00  1 This translates into an earnings per share figure of 31.1p, rise of 6.5% on 2016
   0.00  1 On our total dividend of 25.5p a share is up 6.3% year-on-year
   0.25  0 The loan-to-value ratio is 36% at December 2017, stable on last year
   0.00  1 shopping centers generated an uplift of 1.8% with significant contributions from centers in Reading, Southampton, and Glasgow
   0.00  1 French retail had a good year, with uplifts at Marseille and Cergy being the main drivers of a 2.6% growth
   0.00  1 The table in the top right shows how shopping center core rents grew by 2.3% in 2017
   0.00 -1 This is due to some lower volumes and the one-off impact business rates
   0.08  0 Now on this page, we present the adjusted profit walk, which explains year-on-year changes from last year's reported number of GBP 230.7 million shown in blue on the left
   0.00  1 There was a modest year-on-year increase in administration expenses although the cost-income ratio fell
   0.00  1 Our net interest expenses increased by GBP 10.9 million as a consequence of the loan to property conversion in Ireland reducing interest receivable
  -0.20  0 There was a corresponding offset in the net acquisitions bar
  -0.14  0 Looking at the bar, you can see how it's fallen by 490 basis points over that period to 21.6% in 2017
  -0.12  0 And it's instructed to compare our 2017 ratio with Intu's at 19.4% as shown in the orange bar
  -0.08  1 This is in addition to the corporate overhead synergies of GBP 25 million per annum, as previously announced, which will serve to reduce the corporate tax expenses bar in blue
   0.00  1 shopping centers, is up 0.7% over the year with 1.1 percentage points of income growth being partially offset by targeted CapEx shown in the other column
   0.00  1 In France, our portfolio was up 0.3%
   0.00 -1 And shown in the next row is our Ireland portfolio down 0.3%
   0.00  1 Although income growth was strong at 3.5%, in the other column we have the impact of the one-off stamp duty increase in the autumn
   0.00  1 Without the stamp duty increase, values would have been up 3.9% year-on-year
   0.00  1 Overall, the total portfolio had a capital return of 2.2%, the vast majority of which was from uplifts in income
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet remains solid and consistent with our financing policies
   0.00 -1 Gearing at year-end was 58%, down 1 percentage points on last year
   0.20  0 And the LTV ratio at December '17 of 36% stable on the previous year
  -0.25  0 We had substantial liquidity of nearly GBP 1 billion at December 2017
  -0.10  1 Our hedging policies will continue to be around the 80% level, providing protection from interest rate and foreign exchange volatility
  -0.17  0 And let's look at the disposal program in more detail
  -0.10  0 Since 2015, we and Intu have sold a total of GBP 2 billion of property with an average disposal run rate of around GBP 660 million per annum
  -0.25  0 This is shown in the blue bars on the left
  -0.15  0 Looking forward, we have identified a further group of disposal candidates of at least GBP 2 billion, including properties in the Intu portfolio and this is shown in the green bar
  -0.25  0 This is shown in the red bar on the right
  -0.12  1 And let's consider the last 5 years where earnings per share has risen nearly 50% since 2012, as shown by the blue bars
   0.00  1 Now looking forward over the medium term, we've identified positive or negative trends and these are assigned to the categories shown in the boxes
   0.00 -1 market is tough at the moment
   0.00  1 And finally, we believe the overhead synergies will be significant
   0.00  1 And at the time of the Intu transaction announcement, we stated that the deal is expected to be earnings per share accretive
   0.10  0 The package is mainly Bicester partnership positions, which takes our economic interest to over 50% of this amazing village
   0.00  1 International tourism continues to be an important driver of outlet sales growth throughout Europe
   0.00  1 The year- on-year growth rates by source market, as shown in the table, China is our biggest market and grew 16% over the year
    nan  1 And South and East Asia were also up 17%
   0.00 -1 The Gulf was impacted by events in Saudi
   0.00  1 But Russia and India grew strongly, as you can see
   0.00  1 And in total, tax-free sales are growing 14% over the year, as you can see at the bottom of the table
   0.00  1 Now I think it's well understood by our shareholders, the long-term investment in premium outlets has generated superb returns
   0.11  0 We've been conscious of requests to provide more information on a center- by-center performance
   0.00  1 You can see the larger villages near Bicester, Madrid and Barcelona offer a combination of strong rental growth and comfortable yields
   0.00  1  Thank you, Timon, and good morning
   0.00 -1 But before I do that, what better way to get things off with another stunning picture and this one is our Las Vegas themed event, which marked the launch of our Riverside project in Oracle in Reading last year, and it was quite a night
   0.00  1 And leasing has been strong across all of our portfolio, in the U.K., France and Ireland
   0.00  1 Homewares have been strong across the parks, for example, Oak Furniture Land and Fabb Sofas
   0.14  0 So retailers were investing in ever   more attractive environments, as illustrated here on the right
   0.00  1 Now in the top right, highlighted here in red, you have categories where store sales are currently performing most strongly
   0.00  1 For example, ath-leisure brands such as JD Sports are in strong demand by our shoppers
   0.00 -1 For example, New Look, where sales have been under pressure
   0.00  1 Demand from consumer brands highlighted here in blue, such as Samsung, Nespresso, Bose and VW are growing
   0.00  1 So we're seeing more experiential, aspirational fashion brands like Paul Smith, All Saints, and Jo Malone in this segment and also online names like sofa.com
   0.00 -1 Leasing to high street fashion is down
   0.00  1 Topshop will be a good example here
   0.11  0 Clearly, this has attracted it's fair share of headlines recently, but like retail, the market is segmented
   0.00  1 On the left, grab-and-go operators are performing well and the sector is growing again having faced new competition
   0.08  0 McDonald's, I'm sure, everyone's guilty pleasure, is a great example of evolving their store fit as well as menu
   0.00  1 On the right, the aspirational dining sector is also doing well, and we are seeing high quality brands such The Ivy and D&D expanding
   0.00  1 However, those on the right of the mid box with sufficiently differentiated offer are performing well such as L'Osteria and Franco Manca
  -0.33  0 market, shown here by the gray bars
   0.00  1 Now on the right are 3 examples of how we've positively rotated the portfolio in response to weaker performance
   0.00  1 However, our 6 units traded well, and we were able to successfully reassign all 6 leases and assign higher rents on these units
   0.17  0 Leasing is progressing, including agreements reached with Marks & Spencer's and John Lewis
   0.14  0 In Croydon, we continue to make progress with our JV partners, Westfield
   0.11  0 So we can consider this development from 2019 subject to pre-letting, detail design and construction pricing progress
   0.00 -1 As Timon referred to, valuations for the parks have slipped and ERV growth has been muted
   0.00  1 Good leasing activity in 2017 was principally delivered through our 4 developments, which were on track to generate an income return of around 8% on the GBP 105 million being invested
   0.00  1 We're seeing good demand from homewares operators, Rugby and Kirkcaldy, a value line up at Swansea and a convenience let-off at Didcot, where we now have 60% pre-let with the remaining units to be leased post completion
   0.00  1 And you can see from the numbers, our team are very good at sourcing and delivering income generative developments
   0.00  1 And the backdrop continues to be robust
   0.00  1 We've delivered another year of strong operational performance and delivering on our 4% to 5% ERV growth target per annum at Dundrum
   0.00 -1 Now we're seeing the medium term asset management initiatives bear fruit
   0.00  1 At Dundrum, we've exchanged contracts to introduce Fallon & Byrne, a contemporary 10,000-square-foot food hall and dining concept that will further enhance the offer at our flagship Dublin venue
   0.12  0   Looking at the longer term, we're progressing with the master plan for Dundrum Phase 2
   0.00  1  Thank you, Mark, and good morning
   0.00  1 The graph on the top left demonstrate that this favorable context is translating into a growing consumer confidence, which has reached, again, a 10-year record since the global financial crisis
   0.00  1 And as in the U.K., the volume of leasing across our portfolio has reached a historical high of 9% versus last year
   0.00  1 Rents signed, 5% ahead of ERVs and ERV growth, shy of 1%
  -0.08  0 So after the disposal of Villebon and Angers in 2016, we sold 2 assets in 2017, Place des Halles, Strasbourg and Nancy, Saint Sébastien in Nancy for a total consideration of GBP 295 million
   0.20  0 And we continue obviously to invest to enhance these assets further
   0.00  1 Les Terrasses du Port continues to report very solid turnover performance with sales up 9% versus 2016
   0.33  0 We are also progressing the extension opportunity which I'll comment later
   0.00  1 And finally at Les 3 Fontaine in Cergy, we have acquired the connecting and adjacent center, Cergy 3, last year, unlocking the development potential at the scheme
   0.25  0 Early works having already begun, the main construction will commence in March
   0.50  0 But hopefully, all valuable insight and also a further understanding of the opportunity in our acquisition of Intu
   0.07  0 You saw from my earlier slide, we will have   increased Intu exposure to higher-growth destination shopping centers, that is more of those 8s, 9s and 10s
  -0.33  0 We have a clear rationalization program
  -0.07  1 Firstly, it's important to stress that the results presented to you today have demonstrated our team's ability to deliver a strong operating performance, which we are committed to doing during 2018
   0.00  1 Our detail planning for the merging of the 2 businesses is also well underway
   0.33  0 We've set up an Integration Committee and appointed Sophie Ross as Integration Director to lead the process
   0.10  0 Sophie originally joined the business as Head of Multichannel and has held senior strategy positions at major retailers in the U.K
   0.00 -1 So to conclude, our business continues to perform at a time of ongoing structural change in retail
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -1.00  0 And now over to you for your questions
  -0.33  0 Just a couple of housekeeping questions
  -0.10  0 And I think when you announced the acquisition, you talked a little about your intentions for branding shopping centers a little bit along the lines of Intu
  -0.11  0 Can you just clarify whether your thinking has moved on that at all since you made the announcement?  What if I start with the second question then hand over to Timon
  -0.25  0 Exactly how, that would manifest itself, but that is still absolutely our intent
   0.00  1 So we know some of the existing investors very well
  -0.17  0 The key question behind this statement, in my understanding, is how much of your portfolio is not all those channels or a proportion of that
  -0.05  0 And in that context, telling us what sort of pricing we could expect from the GBP 2 billion of assets you've been selling, knowing that I would like to have what has been a discount to your book value for the 2017 disposals you've made because you're stating 2% over the past 3 years but, I guess, precisely for '17, it's a little bit more than that
  -0.17  0 However, we're going further than that in saying,   we want to dispose of around 10% of the combined portfolio
   0.00  1 So arguably, we're being more disciplined and we're trying almost to get ahead of the curve, if you like, in terms of the way that these centers will evolve
  -0.20  0 This is not a disposal of secondary assets by any stretch of the imagination, Marc
   0.33  0 I've got a few, please
   0.25  0 So that does lead to a marginal increase in costs
   0.12  0 Effectively, you're not paying a third-party supplier a margin to provide so services
   0.00  1 We're looking very closely at that model and that may well give rise to some further cost savings within the combined business
   0.00  1 It's clearly our goal to reduce the cost income ratio below Intu's
   0.00  1 And I think there's a good chance we get there in the next couple of years
  -0.20  0 The second question's related to France and the ERV movement there
  -0.12  0 Or is there still more work to be done there in respect of capital recycling?  So it's partly late
  -0.14  0 I noticed that the occupancy cost ratio increased quite substantially
   0.00 -1 And I think you referenced the falling sales and obviously the impact of business rates in there
   0.00  1 So again, a pretty substantial increase
   0.08  0 And this is the halo effect of -- that physical retail provides in terms of pushing further sales online, providing click-and-collect services, returns and so on
  -0.12  0 We've even had conversations with a very large well-known retailer in our portfolio recently that they openly suggested it was 40% understated
   0.00  1 A record level of leasing suggests that there is much higher productivity and value coming from our physical units than that OCR figure suggests
  -0.33  0 Just a follow-on question, I guess
   0.00 -1 So we've given some numbers today about how we're reducing our leasing to, what I would call, high-street fashion brands
   0.00  1 Those are the retailers with significant online presence
   0.11  0 I think that there are plenty of emerging retailers, and Mark gave the details about -- retailers like Ted Baker, Anthropologie and the like who, frankly, inspire shoppers in other ways and provide a service and personal service, which the shoppers themselves are reacting to
   0.08  0 But I'm, as I say, overall happy that the -- even the relatively high OCRs for those high-street fashion brands, frankly, don't really provide evidence of the real value of those units
  -0.14  1 So very good results in the context of what is a difficult trading environment, especially for your retailers
  -0.14  0 Because I think it's worth just dwelling on that, before I answer that question?    Yes
   0.00 -1 I mean, there's some pressure on certain retailers right now and there are some well-publicized retailers in the headlines
   0.00  1 But we feel very able to deal with that
  -0.25  0 So New Look are being a good example in the press this weekend
  -0.25  0  And then coming to the second part of your question, Hemant
   0.00  1 I think it's worth reinforcing the point about our confidence about the disposals
   0.17  0 Now again, we've moved forward and it's easy to forget
  -0.14  0 Frankly, having announced GBP 2 billion of disposals, as you might imagine, some investors have approached us
  -0.17  0 Now if I'm wrong, then remember, we have only GBP 200 million worth of committed developments
  -0.07  0 We also are looking at starting Brent Cross later in the year, Croydon the year after, but it would be very easy to defer those in the development starts if those discussions we have ongoing with investors today come to nothing and I'm wrong
  -0.25  0 First question just on the U.K
   0.00  1 Looks like you had 2 years of record leasing in the U.K
  -0.25  0 And then the second question on U.K
  -0.17  0 And you were talking about larger lot sizes sort of suffering
  -0.20  0 A question on the mid-market F&B, showing quite some dramatic numbers, basically
  -0.17  0 So in terms of those current retailers who are in leases being under -- or occupied under stress
  -0.33  0 And in our CVA [ barring ] another one, we have 3 units in our CVA
   0.00 -1 They, on a portfolio perspective, overexpanded a lot of competition from that casual dining burger, or sort of the burger market
   0.00  1 I mean, we're seeing some good brands coming through who are really differentiated
   0.00  1 I know these are good concepts
  -0.33  0  And one other question actually on Brent Cross
   0.25  0 We're working for the construction costs
   0.00  1 It's a -- Brent Cross is a very high-quality catchment, really strong growth prospects
   0.00  1 And on that basis, we've got good interest and we're comfortable we're going to put it in place during the course of this year 
   0.00  1 We've managed our commitments in France, which is good
  -0.25  0 Well, in that case, we'll have another call on -- or another question in the room
  -0.20  0 Just following the question on U.K
  -0.11  0 Press reports currently suggest that there are deals under negotiation at discounts to prevailing asset values
   0.07  0 And secondly, is there a level of triple-net NAV bandwidth that you feel you can accommodate, given of [ our ] actual use of the deal and that would be a way that you could encourage people about the capital discipline?    Yes
   0.25  0 And the vendor effectively is a fund-in runoff
   0.00  1 So I think there are for good reasons why the pricing might be below NAV
  -0.33  0 Having said that, our valuers also read the press
   0.00 -1 So I don't believe at the moment that, that deal on Bluewater, if it happened, would lead to an erosion of value on our end portfolio
   0.17  0 [indiscernible]  Please use the microphone just so people can hear you online
   0.33  0 So if we could run the video, please

   0.00  1                                                                   So good afternoon from Hong Kong
   0.00  1 Now 2017 was a good year for HSBC
   0.00  1 We continued to grow lending in our target markets, especially Hong Kong and the U.K
  -0.10  1 Commercial Banking adjusted revenue grew well on the back of an outstanding performance in Global Liquidity and Cash Management
   0.00  1 Global Trade and Receivables Finance revenues stabilized after a difficult 2016
   0.00  1 And we increased our market share in key geographies
   0.00  1 Adjusted loan impairment charges were significantly lower than 2016 due mainly to improved conditions in the oil and gas industry in North America
   0.12  0 Our strong equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.5% included the effect of recent changes in U.S
   0.14 -1 tax legislation, which reduced our capital position by 9 basis points
  -0.09  0 Our policy is to consider buybacks where appropriate, subject to the execution of targeted capital actions and regulatory approval
   0.00  1 The reported return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 5.9%, up from 0.8% in 2016
   0.00  1 The reported return on average tangible equity was 6.8%, up from 2.6%
   0.00  1 Adjusted profit before tax was up by $2.1 billion or 11% due to higher revenue and lower loan impairment charges
   0.00  1 Retail Banking and Wealth Management had a particularly good year with a 24% increase on 2016
   0.00  1 Fourth quarter revenue from our global businesses was $400 million or 3% higher than last year's fourth quarter
   0.00  1 As Slide 7 shows, Retail Banking and Wealth Management revenue grew by 8% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year
   0.00  1 Wider spreads and higher balances in Hong Kong helped grow revenue from current account, savings and deposits by $370 million
   0.00  1 Income from investment distribution increased by $98 million from higher sales, particularly in Hong Kong
   0.00  1 We grew customer lending and customer deposits by 7% and 5%, most notably in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom
   0.00 -1 Lending revenue was $117 million lower due to margin compression
   0.00  1 For the full year, revenue was up by 9%, with strong performances across the business
   0.00  1 Commercial Banking revenue was 11% higher than last year's fourth quarter
   0.00  1 Global Liquidity and Cash Management had another excellent quarter, growing revenue by 16% due to higher spreads and balance sheet growth in Asia
   0.00  1 Credits and lending grew by 5% due mainly to balance sheet growth in Hong Kong and the U.K
  -0.12  1 Full year revenue was 5% up on 2016, mainly driven by Global Liquidity and Cash Management in Hong Kong
  -0.10  1 In Global Banking and Markets, the diversity of our product range helped us withstand the impact of subdued trading conditions in the fourth quarter
   0.00 -1 Revenue was down against a strong fourth quarter performance in 2016
   0.00  1 Also, our transaction banking products continued to generate increased revenue from higher balances
  -0.11  1 In particular, Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue grew by 18%, and Securities Services grew by 15%
   0.00  1 Global Banking and Markets' fourth quarter return on risk-weighted assets was 20 basis points higher than the same period last year, and the business delivered a return on tangible equity of 10.6% in 2017
  -0.11  1 Revenue for the full year was up 3% on 2016, mainly in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and Securities Services
   0.00  1 All of our Global Banking and Markets businesses grew revenue in 2017
   0.00  1 Global Private Banking revenue grew by 2% compared with last year's fourth quarter
   0.00  1 Revenue grew by 8% in our target markets in the fourth quarter, particularly Hong Kong, and by 10% over the full year
   0.00  1 Corporate Centre revenue grew by $695 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016
   0.00 -1 Balance Sheet Management revenue fell by $167 million
   0.00 -1 As a consequence, associated revenue is $129 million lower than last year's fourth quarter
   0.14  0   Slide 12 shows net interest margin, which was broadly stable
   0.00  1 Net interest income of $7.4 billion was $260 million higher than the third quarter
   0.00 -1 Our net interest margin for 2017 was 1.63%, 7 basis points lower than 2016, excluding Brazil
   0.00 -1 Net interest margin fell by 3 basis points from the impact of the CML run-off and margin compression in Europe and Asia, 3 basis points from higher costs of debt and 3 basis points from foreign currency translation
  -0.08  1 This was partly balanced by a 4 basis point increase from higher deposit margins, particularly in Asia and in Global Liquidity and Cash Management
   0.07  0 There's a detailed slide on net interest margin and more information on net interest income sensitivity analysis in the appendix
  -0.25  0 Slide 13 looks at loan impairment charges
   0.00  1 This was $218 million higher than the third quarter due largely to 2 corporate exposures
   0.00  1 Our operating expenses excluding the bank levy were $296 million higher than last year's fourth quarter, reflecting additional investment to grow the business and ongoing investment in digital and IT security
   0.00  1 We invested a further $322 million in business growth in the fourth quarter, mainly in Retail Banking and Wealth Management
   0.14  0 We expect regulatory and compliance spending to remain broadly stable
  -0.07  0 Common equity Tier 1 capital reduced by $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter due mainly to the fourth quarter dividend and a reduction in the value of our deferred assets as a result of changes in U.S
  -0.20  0 The fully loaded day 1 impact is expected to be negligible
   0.00  1 The return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 5.9%, up from 0.8% in 2016
   0.00  1 And the return on tangible shareholders' equity was 6.8%, up from 2.6%
  -0.12  0 We're now disclosing our return on tangible equity by global business
   0.17  0 By the end of 2017, we had achieved 8 of the 10 actions we set out at our 2015 investor update
   0.00  1 This included actions to reduce group risk-weighted assets, deliver cost savings, accelerate our pivot to Asia and implement Global Standards
   0.00  1 We exceeded our group risk-weighted asset reduction target by more than 20% and our Global Banking and Markets target by 31%
   0.00  1 We've increased returns at the same time, growing our return on risk-weighted assets from 1.5% in 2014 to 2% in 2017
   0.25  0   Slide 20 looks at NAFTA profitability
   0.00 -1 While the low interest rate environment has held back the U.S
   0.00  1 business paid the first dividend to the group in more than a decade
   0.00  1 We increased the international client revenue actually booked in the U.S
   0.08  0 Slide 21 shows that we have delivered on our commitment to an -- achieve an exit run rate for 2017 equivalent to our 2014 cost base
   0.00  1 We've delivered run rate savings of $6.1 billion since 2015, more than $1 billion above the top end of our Investor Day target range
   0.20  0 We've invested a total of $7 billion in costs to achieve between 2014 and 2017
   0.12  0 You can find examples of how these programs have made us a better bank on Slide 35 in the appendix
   0.00  1 As a consequence, we've increased the proportion of client revenue that comes from international clients from 50% in 2015 to 53% in 2017
   0.00  1 We've also grown our market share in key trade finance markets, increased balances and captured market share in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and maintained our leadership at the corporate foreign exchange market
   0.00  1 We've also increased transaction banking revenue by 5% since 2015, whilst 30% of group revenue now comes directly from transaction banking, up from 29% 2 years ago
   0.00  1 We've grown our lending and insurance income in Hong Kong since 2014
   0.00  1 We've rapidly grown lending in the Pearl River Delta; launched new products; and established new businesses, including the first security joint venture in Mainland China to being majority owned by an international bank
   0.00  1 We've grown assets under management in Asia by 49% and increased annualized new business insurance premiums in Asia by 32% since 2014
   0.00  1 We have strong revenue growth and a robust capital ratio
  -0.14  1 Our investments in Global Standards in risk and compliance helped pave the way for our exit since 2012's deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S
  -0.29  0 Department of Justice, although financial crime prevention and strong compliance remain a daily focus for us
   0.00  1 First, we're doing a lot of work to refresh our strategy and accelerate delivery
  -0.10  1 And finally, the fundamentals of HSBC will remain the same as they always have: strong funding and liquidity, strong capital and a conservative approach to credit
   0.00  1 So we're very happy to take questions
  -0.20  0 The operator will now explain the procedure and introduce the first question
  -0.14  0 Operator?    [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question today from Mr
   1.00  0 Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies, please
  -0.50  0  Just a couple of questions
  -0.11  0 So I'm just wondering, like, what should we see as the trajectory of the NIM now that we've had the drag from the CML eliminated
  -0.25  0 The key drivers for 2017 are set out in the slide quite clearly
   0.00  1 And that program continues in 2018 to ensure we meet the regulatory guidance over the medium term
   0.00 -1 That's the less-favorable news
  -0.08  1 The more favorable news is that -- is in that last point, where we saw higher spreads coming through liabilities, our deposit base and surplus liquidity principally over the course of the year
   0.00 -1 In addition, one of the things that we experienced in 2017 were tighter margins on the liability side and the U.K
   0.00 -1 The headwinds in that regard, some have been eliminated, as you point out
  -0.10  0 So there are quite a few entities to be wound down, but I think in the round, the cost of winding down some 50 entities is literally in the rounding from an HSBC perspective
  -0.33  0 As it relates to the DPA, you'll recall that the penalty that was assessed in us in 2012 was $1.9 billion
  -0.25  0 Our next question today comes from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America
  -0.30  0  I feel a little bad asking this question, but the buyback guidance is some of the least useful that we've had in quite some time
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.06  0 And your CET1 is already so high that you've effectively filled your Tier 1 requirements with common equity, so it feels like there's an awful lot of capital kicking around in the business
  -0.25  0 And you obviously will recall we did a buyback in the second half of last year, and that precluded some [ additions ] activity which we may otherwise have wanted to do
  -0.33  0 Our next question today comes from Robert Noble from Royal Bank of Canada
   0.00 -1 And you pulled out a comment that said there was spread compression in Asia and the corporate, but -- and I was wondering
  -0.14  0 There is a lot of liquidity [ doing the rounds ] not only in this part of the world but globally, and the pressure has been consistent
   0.00  1 And that DPA has now come to an end on the back of a significant investment and work that was done in terms of improving the overall firm's ability with respect to financial crime risk management
   0.00  1 The -- as we discussed in previous quarters, our ability to extricate surplus capital from the U.S
  -0.08  0 was very much informed by CCAR and having nonobjections to the results for stress tests and capital plans associated with those stress tests in previous years
  -0.06  1 And we were successful in pulling a quite significant amount of surplus capital from the U.S., in line with those capital plans to which the Federal Reserve raised no objection in 2017
   0.00  1 Actually, it's up 7%
   0.00  1 It was up USD 22 billion net
   0.25  0 And that's largely informed by growth in the United Kingdom
  -0.20  0 Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan
   0.00  1 And within that, obviously you've got 12%   growth in mortgage balances in Hong Kong, 7% growth in the U.K
   0.11 -1 And I was wondering if you have any thoughts on some of the pressures that we are seeing, especially in the business services sector and construction
   0.00 -1 And there one see slightly benign, more so than perhaps one would expect
   0.00  1 We've seen a slight uptick in retail bank Wealth Management in Mexico, but that was expected on the back of the nature of business that we're growing there, particularly within retail banking Wealth Management, with a slightly higher proportion of unsecured personal credit in that particular marketplace
   0.00  1 Going back to credit and lending growth: I think one of the things which does not necessarily show up by an examination of the fourth quarter balance sheet was how strong credit and lending in Global Banking and Markets and particularly in Asia had been last year
   0.17  0 We continue to hold a very prudent position with respect to underwriting
  -0.07  1 And as we continue to expand the broker channel, I think we now have 23 brokers that give us line of sight to the marketplace, we are seeing more of the market obviously and are quite keen to continue to grow share in that space
   0.00 -1 Overall stock in the market is still slightly below 7% market share
   0.00  1 So on the RBWM side, mortgages in the U.K., you should expect us to continue to compete aggressively there and to continue to take market share as we leverage back into the intermediary space, an area that we've been absent from for a while
  -0.17  1 I mean in Hong Kong the market remains extremely competitive, but we will defend our market share there
   0.00  1 And our third biggest retail business, Mexico, there is still room for us to grow into our footprint
   0.00  1 So across the retail space you should expect to see continued asset growth
  -0.14  0 Doesn't it [ square off, no ]? Our next question today comes from Chris Manners from Barclays
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions, if I may
  -0.25  0 And the second one is I had a couple of questions on the ring-fenced bank
  -0.10  0 When I look at the ring-fenced bank's sort of illustrative balance sheet, you do look like you have a lot of liquidity there
  -0.33  0 So 25% of the balance sheet is liquid assets
   0.00  1 And as John pointed out, we do have a very strong liquidity position within the ring-fenced bank
  -0.06  1 So absolutely that will be part of the challenge to continue to look at how we optimize the ring-fenced bank balance sheet and put to good use the resources that we have in it, but it would be fair to say we have a very safe balance sheet going into the start of trading with that bank in the 1st of July this year
   0.05  0 On the group's common equity Tier 1 ratio, I think, certainly over the course of the last 12 months, we've tried to encourage you to think about the top end of our 12% to 13% range from a common equity Tier 1 perspective
  -0.11  0 And certainly, if we reflect on the output of regulatory buffers on the back of stress tests, then the tendency has been to move the Pillar 2 requirements a little bit higher on the back of those stress tests
   0.00  1 And how much above 13%, we'll get better indication when we get some guidance from our principal regulators around how they intend to interpret and apply the learnings from the stress tests of 2017
   0.00  1  So it's above 13%
  -0.25  0 Our next question today comes from Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley
  -0.33  0  I've got 2 questions
  -0.50  0 So that's question one
  -0.20  0 I'll start with the first question, so our investment spend
   0.11  0 But what we have been doing over the last couple of years is investing in new technology, bringing technology into the bank to make it easier for customers the bank with us and to automate processes either to reduce headcount or to make it easier for staff to get on and do their jobs
   0.00  1 All of that investment, of course, will be subject to the positive jaws constraint
   0.17  0 the customer satisfaction you've talked about kind of earlier in the conversation
   0.06  0 So the things that are visible to you and to our customers, the things you can see are part of it, but an awful lot of the investment has gone into the middle- and the back-end processes either to improve the technology platforms that support the business and/or to automate processes that are currently very manual
  -0.04  0  And there is a very significant amount of investment in the area of meeting regulatory compliance requirements simply with respect to the amount of reporting that we now do for our regulators around the world, whether it's with respect to capital, risk-weighted assets, liquidity, overall exposure from a credit perspective
  -0.07  0  There's quite a bit of detail on Slide 35 in the appendix which gives you a bit of a sort of touches to some -- where some of the middle- and back-office expenditure has been
  -0.10  1 It's -- as you say, it's the volatility has contributed to higher volumes that we've seen come through
  -0.20  0 Your next question comes from Fahed Kunwar from Redburn
  -0.50  0  I just had a couple of questions
  -0.19  1 Obviously you've got good, higher yields on the surplus liquidity in the year, but Hibor since the beginning of the year has fallen quite sharply, it's off about 50 bps in the beginning of the year
   0.00 -1 I'm just wondering
   0.18  0 And the investment spend will be kind of under the constraint of positive jaws, but at the moment, consensus close to 3% kind of positive jaws for the next 2 to 3 years
  -0.11  1 Or do you think that's just still a little bit elevated?  Fahed, I think your memory is quite good actually
  -0.25  1 I like that guidance quite a lot
   0.00 -1 Okay, so the fourth quarter was the outlier
  -0.25  0 The next question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane
   0.00 -1 I just wondered
  -0.50  0 That's my first question
  -0.50  0  Fire away, Tom
   0.10  0 I know you're still targeting positive jaws, but just the sort of potential sort of size of those jaws
   0.12  0 You're talking about, so -- or John, I think you were talking about wanting to invest more as revenue improves
   0.15  0 So my sense is that, if we're talking positive jaws, we might be more 1% than 3%, but I'm just trying to get a feel for what you're -- you think the potential is there, please
  -0.14  1  Yes, Tom, I think 1% to 1.5%, 2% is pretty good guidance around the jaws number, per the previous questions
  -0.10  0 And there are listing authority regulations which simply preclude us from doing a buyback at the same time as AT1s, or vice versa for that matter
   0.08  0 I think, as far as Basel IV goes, as you probably know as well, if not better than I, there are over 60 areas of national discretion now available within the guidance that was published back in December
   0.08 -1 And for an organization that operates across 67 markets with some 40 regulators, the opportunity to apply national discretions across a broad range of dimensions within Basel IV creates some uncertainty for us
   0.08  0 For those that have provided guidance, I think what characterizes them is they tend to operate in a relatively small number of markets and may have benefited from the fact of some guidance from the regulators already
   0.00 -1 So yes, there is some uncertainty in terms of the impact
   0.07  0 And as we get greater guidance, we'll be sure to provide you with some guidance when it becomes meaningful to do, but that's not what's influenced our decision with respect to buybacks at first -- at the end of the year
  -0.25  0 Our next question today comes from Michael Helsby from Bank of America
  -0.33  0  I've got 2 questions, if I can
   0.04  0 Thanks for Slide 33, you've given us the future sensitivity in the outer-years to the future move in the yield curve, but clearly, 2017, we saw rates moving already, which does imply that you're, for want of a better word, already pregnant with a higher net interest income in the outer- years
   0.11  0 So I was wondering if you could actually quantify that NII benefit for us in '18, '19, '20 like you've done in that slide
   0.00  1 And obviously you've got an FX tailwind in the U.K
   0.00  1 It does imply that consensus NII of $30.6 billion looks extremely mean
   0.00 -1 I was just wondering if you thought that was a fair observation
   0.00 -1  Okay, so you don't think that consensus NII in 2018 looks too low
  -0.20  0 Our next question comes from Ronit Ghose from Citigroup
  -1.00  0 2 more questions..
   0.08  0 And as I say, as we work through the first quarter and have a few months of trading activity behind us and a better sense as to how the year is playing out, we'll continue to update you as we get to that point in time
  -0.07  0 Consensus jaws are clearly quite a bit broader than your guidance, so I'm guessing that the consensus costs number, rather than the consensus revenue number, is where the difference is versus your expectations
  -0.11  0 And I have a second, more broader question, and maybe that's more for your incoming CEO, about open banking in the U.K
   0.00 -1 I think that range still holds true
   0.05  0 At this point, we have one of our principal regulators that has provided some reasonably firm guidance on this on MREL and the positioning of MREL across the group, and that's the potential regulation authority in the U.K
   0.10  0 And if you think about that continued investments in the growth of the business to be bound by 1% to 1.5% to 2% positive jaws, then don't multiply 7.6 times 4
   0.00  1 And I think, with that, it gives you the ability to model out what this may look like with a reasonable degree of accuracy as the results flow through
  -0.11  0  And I'll pick up on the -- so with respect to the question on open banking: It's open banking is here
  -0.18  0 The potential disruption that this could cause, we think, is quite significant, so it's therefore important for us to be in early, testing and learning and experimenting with this
   0.00  1 I'm very proud of that
  -0.25  0 We will take our last question today from Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs
   0.08 -1 And I just wondered if you could shed a little bit of light on the launch of new -- of the new intermediary mortgage platform, which I think has successfully launched in 4Q
   0.00 -1 And I was just wondering
  -0.08  0 And the second question is just a follow-up on Slide 33 and the incremental disclosure on NII sensitivity over time, and I was just wondering if I read this correctly
  -0.17  0 And I was just wondering if that is an indication that you have fairly limited amount of structural hedging in place
   0.00  1 I think we -- well, the figures show that we took our market share of approvals from 8% in '16 up to 9% during the quarters '17, so we're up roughly 1% on the year
  -0.50  0 We have time for one more question
  -0.50  0 Your next question comes from David Lock from Deutsche Bank
   0.00 -1 The core Tier 1 looks like it fell from 15.3 to 14.2 quarter-on-quarter
  -0.05  0 I just wondered if you -- if it was too early; or if you maybe had any initial thoughts on what you thought the impact could be for your long-term tax rate; and if there's any beat implications, particularly given you obviously fund a lot of the group out of the holding company
  -0.10  0  So the answer to your first question was upstreaming of surplus capital was the driver of the reduction in the capital ratios within the U.S
  -0.18  0 And then on the tax change, we've got $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion impairment on the deferred tax assets in the U.S
   0.06  0 And if it doesn't, then obviously we clearly benefit from a lower corporate tax rate going forward, but we do need to have a clearer read on the guidance from the IRS before we make that final determination
   0.00 -1 And on the beat, I just wondered
   0.00  1 business

    Differences: 197/557


---FILE: Informa plc.txt

   0.00  1 It's very nice to see Tim and Marina at the back of the hall
  -0.20  0 The standard disclaimer is as you would expect, and that takes us straight into where we are today
  -0.12  0 That necessitated and required quite a significant change the way in which we manage the business, and indeed, some of the people who manage the business
   0.08  0 We took a very early decision that we would build and buy a position in the Global Exhibitions market, and that's largely where we have focused our acquisition capital over the last period
   0.05  0 And that plan, which pivoted around those 6 pillars was designed to try and get us to a point, whereby, we could progressively return the business into growth, and at the same time, build some capabilities, which would allow us to then go on and do more at the end of that Growth Acceleration Plan period
   0.00  1 I think we're in reasonable shape
  -0.17  0 I don't want to overstate this because we are still very much in building capability mode
   0.00  1 And we learned a lot about ourselves, and indeed, about how to do that in the last 18 months
  -0.33  0 And that will be relevant to what hopefully lies ahead of us
   0.09  0 In 2017, we sold a majority position in Euroforum, our last remaining [ scale ] European Conference business in Germany, to our actually then licensed partner now, majority owner, Handelsblatt
   0.12  0 We retain a minority position for reasons of   relationship and actually market access if we need it
  -0.10  0 And we further added some capability in the Open Access market through the addition of Dove Medical Press in Academic Publishing
  -0.17  0 But we may will get to it in questions, and we will just do a short update on timing at the end
   0.00  1 Our Exhibitions business did another strong year of good growth, slightly ahead of the market
   0.00  1 Our Academic Publishing business, steady growth, strong year-end
    nan  1 And we had a strong November and December
   0.00  1 Business intelligence continues to tick upwards
  -0.14  0 The EPS number, which Gareth will break down, is a mixture of our currency tax and trading
   0.09  0 The first was to build and buy our scale position in B2B Events, which again sitting here in February 2018, kind of looks like an obvious thing to do
  -0.06  1 Or is there an essence of that business which has long term sustainable defensible value?" And we took the latter view, and so we have exited quite a number of markets, products, geographies, but we've kept the core of that business which we think has long term sustainability, whether our branded events, confexes, product with quality and sustainable differentiation, where you can charge a premium price for the quality and service you're delivering to your customers
   0.00 -1 Less obviously and the area where we were at the time having the most difficulty in 2012, 2013 is what we now call Business Intelligence, what the market [ bearishly ] calls Information Services, where in truth, we were really a bit of a novate
  -0.33  0 And there was a question mark over whether or not really we should be in this business at all
   0.17  0 Where having assets which were overlapping, whether they be in B2B Events or information or data or products or service provision would be long-term beneficial
   0.00  1 And therefore -- but if we'd exited that market, we might well have built a strong position in B2B Events, but it would ultimately be a limiting place to be until we had scale
   0.33  0 We wanted to build a position in the United States
   0.00  1 How many times have people like me stood at podiums like this in the United Kingdom and said, that's a good idea
  -1.00  1 So we did it very slowly
   0.00  1 We needed to trade, so we needed to deliver growth
   0.07  0 We needed to deliver progressive dividend returns to shareholders who stayed with us, but what we also needed to do was to build capability, invest in ourselves, in our products, in our people, in our platforms, in our systems
   0.06  0 And believe you me, if you were inside the company, you could bump into many people and say, "It's a long way from done, but it's a long way from where it was as well." And that process of building capability, if you want to be in the information and data markets, is where you need to be in a business like ours
  -0.09  1 Those were the initiatives that were the bedrock over the last 4 years and many people inside the company have been focused on doing, and in large part, delivering pretty well against those objectives over the time
   0.00  1 Reported revenue increased by 30.7% to GBP 1.76 billion
   0.00  1 Our underlying revenue growth was 3.4%, an acceleration over the 1.6% organic growth delivered in 2016
  -0.33  0 Breaking that growth down into its components
   0.00  1 As a result of this earnings growth, the board's commitment to increase the dividend by 6% to 20.45p per share, was covered around 2.25x by earnings
   0.00  1 The most important thing for us was a 3.4%, added through underlying trading, increasing from the 1.6% we delivered in the previous year
   0.00  1 And all this adds up to an overall increase in actual reported revenue of around 31% in 2017
   0.00  1 We took the approach to combine the Penton business into the divisions of Informa that they were most likely to thrive in
   0.25  0 So the operating synergies of Penton have been achieved in 3 main areas
   0.09  0 And taking these each in turn, and in terms of 2018 synergies that we're aiming to achieve, our corporate overhead reduction, approximately 15% of the GBP 22.5 million gross savings are coming from the reduction of duplicate costs across executive leadership and other corporate and group functions
  -0.25  0 In terms of management and support restructuring
  -0.06  0 Approximately 50% of the savings are expected to be generated from the reduction of duplicate management cost, including the rationalization of overlapping IT systems, processes and associated investment spend
   0.00  1 We delivered operational performance with all 4 divisions in growth in 2017
   0.00  1 Global Exhibitions delivered underlying revenue growth of 7.6%, delivered by strong performance from the top 30 exhibitions
   0.00  1 Margins increased -- margins decreased by 1 percentage point as we invested in the division, and we added the slightly lower margin YPI business, but the outturn was still a 6.5% increase in OP
   0.00  1 OP increased by 6.2%, as BI was the largest beneficiary of Penton synergy savings
   0.00  1 The revenue growth, ahead of the Q3 IMS, was driven by strong performance in November by far K&Ns largest trading month of the year
   0.10  0 Interest was GBP 59 million, primarily because of the increased debt following Penton, but also not helped by a stronger U.S
   0.14  0 The effective tax rate increased to 21.2%, following change in the U.K
   0.20  0 tax law, but also not benefiting from the increased mix of U.S
   1.00  0 profits in 2017
   0.00  1 And this all added up to a 9.5% increase in EPS, which covered the 6-point -- the 6% increase in the dividend a 2.25x
  -0.33  0 This is a subject very close to my heart, free cash flow
   0.00  1 At the start of 2017, you may remember we set a target of delivering GBP 400 million of free cash flow in the year, which would be an increase of over [ around 1/3 ] over the GBP 306 million we delivered in 2016
   0.07  0 We reported GBP 400.9 million despite the schedule increases in CapEx in the year following the Growth Acceleration Plan and also despite the negative trend in currency movements through the year
   0.00  1 This reflects the strong profit delivery and lower cash tax as we utilized tax credits for losses that came with Penton
   0.00  1 And the free cash flow performance delivered another strong year of free cash flow yield around about 7.1% for the full year
   0.00  1 So the combination of strong cash generation and our balanced approach to funding produced a robust balance sheet at year-end, with net debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5x, back within our target range of 2x to 2.5x
   0.20  0 To strengthen our financing, we funded another $400 million in the U.S
   0.00  1 We continued to deliver the portfolio management element of the GAP strategy, which looks to ensure that we allocate our capital to the parts of the portfolio where we can generate the best returns
  -0.14  1 The sale of the Garland Books business reduced our exposure to the more volatile, lower-level text book market
   0.00  1 The disposal of the majority stake in the Euroforum business increased our focus in K&N on the stronger performing core verticals
   0.00  1 And finally, small-scale disposables in both BI and GE helped improve the performance for these businesses
   0.00 -1 Overall, the group ROCE includes the full year of the Penton business for the first time, which reduced ROCE as expected on the P&L returns basis
   0.00  1 Group revenue growth has increased by almost 2 percentage points
   0.00  1 The compound annual growth in free cash flow has been 17%
   0.00  1 And dividend payments have increased by an average of 4% over that time
  -0.17  0 We're sort of halfway through, and then we'll get to questions
   0.00  1 We are a truly and about to become an even more so international and global business
   0.00 -1 If anything, we will be underrepresented and certainly underweighted by a percentage in the United Kingdom and Europe
  -0.14  0 There is much discussion about the impact of our artificial intelligence and robotics, and [ our growth and ] capability
  -0.50  0 We might get into that in questions
   0.00  1 But what it certainly means is that the power of data and analytics, and knowing and understanding your customers, what they're doing, what they want, where they're going, is going to be a core part of the business in which we operate, and we largely see that not as a headwind but as a helping wind
   0.00  1 In the markets in which we operate, whether that's B2B Events, Business Information or scholarly research, the growth of learning and education, particularly, differentiated learning and education as opposed to mass-market education, again, we see, broadly, helpful, mid- to long-term trends
   0.13  0 In specialist information and indeed in B2B Events, it's all about micro focus and being close to your specific customers, focused scale in the jargon of the Information Services market
   0.20  0 You have to have attendee growth, or certainly attendee stability
   0.17  0 And then we're beginning to move it out across real estate and construction and other categories
  -0.17  0 Business Intelligence, quite a different business model
  -0.09  0 If you open your books on January 1, and you've already lost 30% of your customers, you have to have a new business pipeline to die for if you're going to stay static
  -0.07  0 So we rebased the business, and we focused the business around subscription renewals and contract value and existing customer management, changed the way in which we operate and organized around those customers and around those verticals
   0.14  0 We then layered in consulting, largely as a sales and customer service support, rather than necessarily, as a profit driver
  -0.08  0 I would say not job done but job being done, now on what I recall the hygiene factors of running a business like this
   0.05  0 The price for us, I think, in 2018 and beyond is to take the investments we've made, whether it's in Citeline, in Pharma or in EPFR or in financial services or in ag or in technology, and not just satisfy the people we know, but also bring in some customers that we don't know
  -0.09  1 And if there's a challenge and a task for that business, it is to drive our performance in new business, having done a very strong performance in existing business
   0.00  1 In Academic Publishing, which has been a business of consistent strength, and if I had a pound for every time I've been asked what are you going to do with Academic Publishing question, in the last 5 years, we would we doing very well
   0.00  1 This is a consistent business
   0.00  1 It is a strong business
   0.17  0 If we are successful in the completion of our combination with UBM, it'll be less than 1/5 of the business
   0.00  1 It's a very consistent, reliable and powerful business
    nan  1 We have a powerful brand or indeed brands
   0.00  1 And it's a trend that we are actively participating in, investing in and bringing capability to be able to deliver service to our customers
  -0.20  0 We invested quite a considerable amount of money in that platform
  -0.09  1 I encourage you to go to the artificial intelligence area not just because it's a fascinating current subject, but also, we're one of the world leaders in it
  -0.08  0 On Author Services, we need to more Author Services, because it isn't simply any longer a matter of sourcing content
   0.00  1 It's a very interesting market with lots going on underneath that steady headline of another year of consistent performance
   0.00  1 Those markets are doing well
   0.00  1 The brands in those markets are doing well
   0.00  1 And we, by and large, I think exercised our duty of care to our colleagues in those businesses well and focused the business around where we see long term, sustainable future
   0.12  0 We're building this group over time for scale and performance and Information Services group
   0.00  1 Our revenue mix is materially dollar-denominated, and our revenue type is increasingly more visible and more predictable and gives us a higher level of certainty as we step from one year to the next
   0.00  1 We feel good about where the business is
  -0.17  0 And then, we're anticipating a completion date in Q2 2018, obviously, that's subject to the completion of the now underway antitrust procedural filings
   0.00  1 We're hopeful, therefore, that will take us to the midyear, where we'll be one company
   0.20  0 That will allow us to set at it with our Accelerated Integration Plan
   0.25  0 We have a team that is working, I would say, as collaboratively as you can do
   0.11  0 We see cost savings, but we're not making this proposal in order to achieve cost savings
  -0.25  0 And on that, I will pause and take questions
  -1.00  0 Two questions for me
   0.17  0 You can monetize through straightforward, effectively exhibit prices, but they're digital exhibits for presence and depending on what the scale of that presence is and the ranking of that presence
   0.10  0 And what it also allows you to do is to deepen the nature of your following-year conversation about how you then sell and price and package for the following year because you're dealing with a customer who A, is considerably more invested and embedded in the event, and B, you considerably more information about who their visitors were, what their purchasing cycle was, what their purchase budget was, and how it enables you to then sell to them
   0.00  1 On Annie, it certainly feels longer, and that's a good thing
   0.11  0 She's definitely a firm part of the team, both the Informa leadership team but also the Taylor & Francis team
   0.05  0 I think I said publicly we're not seeking to, because there's been a change in leadership, have a kind of kitchen sink moment where we kind of rebase the business and turn it into something that it isn't or it wasn't because it doesn't need that
   0.00  1 And we also need, I think, to be more ambitious about what we can do internationally
   0.00  1 We have a very nice business in the United States, actually a good business in U.K
   0.00  1 I was about to say emerging markets, but these are well emerged
   0.00  1 China is a global leader in research publishing now
   0.00  1 So we can be more ambitious there and that's where her focus
   0.00 -1 dollar, what you'll see is that margin coming down under pressure going the other way in 2018
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -0.08  0 Obviously, there's been a time lag in terms of when you acquired that business to when you're now talking about potential revenue synergies
  -0.17  0 Or is it something special about the Penton deal that has meant that maybe things have been a little bit delayed?  Okay, thanks very much, Ian
  -0.33  0 I'll try and cut into those
  -0.10  1 And we think the bits that aren't growing are going to decline at a pace and rate, and the bits that are going to grow are going to exceed that, and then we'll get there
  -0.20  0 And you're right, there is a bit of a time lag
   0.00 -1 But the print actually didn't do as badly as we thought or certainly as we modeled
   0.00 -1 So we're not motivated by that outcome
   0.00  1 The event brands have been very strong
   0.00  1 The combination where we've made them with our existing brands, particularly in food ingredients, has been extremely strong
   0.00  1 We're adding into Natural Products Expo this year -- this week and in through next week, and that is looking extremely good
  -0.17  0 We're in the middle of renegotiations and renewals and subscription discussions
   0.00 -1 But there is nothing that's materially worrisome
   0.00  1 We've given previous guidance that we want to have another year of growth
   0.20  0 Obviously, it's a mix because it's a group number, it will depend
   0.00  1 So whilst I think Exhibitions will have another strong year, it won't be as strong, I would suggest, on the headline number as it has been this year
   0.00  1 And K&N, again, I think will be steady
   0.12  0 I don't know if you want to lead the witness any further on that one, Gareth?  Nothing to add to that
  -0.04  0 And then lastly, we kind of touched on this already, but when we're finished with the GAP scheme, we're talking about organic revenue growth of 3.5%, just how much operating leverage can we start to see in the business?  Gareth, do you want to come in on the operational leverage and sorry, what was your second question? Apologies
   0.00  1 But I think it's really pretty steady between the divisions and certainly not a material factor in terms of any of the numbers
   0.33  0 I mean, it's not all hard construction, as you know
   0.20  0 Some of that is surfaces, some of that is interiors, some of that is property development, some of it is physical construction
   0.00 -1 But the only area where we had any real softness was in one particular geography
   0.00 -1 But that was a local issue
   0.00  1 Health and nutrition, very strong across the entire brand so in all geographies
   0.00  1 Life Sciences, similarly, I think very strong
   0.00  1 And MEDLAB last year was the breakout, we repeated this year, again went well
   0.00  1 Aviation, the Events portfolio was very, very strong
   0.00 -1 International Yachting, we had a slight heart-in-the-mouth moment as many people did very genuine reasons around the hurricanes in the United States
   0.00  1 And actually, our entire Yachting portfolio traded strongly
   0.00  1 We've got Palm Beach coming up and again strong
   0.25  0 Beauty and antiaging, largely an Asian business
    nan  1 is strong
  -0.25  1 Utilities, which is largely waste, strong, almost all American pop culture all North American and strong
   0.00  1 So actually, very, very spread
   0.00  1 It was a consistent portfolio performance across geographies
   0.06  0  One point we should, therefore, expect underlying, excluding the UBM acquisition, operating profit growth to be in line or below revenue growth for FY '18?  I don't think we can comment on that
  -0.50  0 Well, but it's a very fair question
   0.00 -1 I was just wondering whether you could add some color on what that trend means for margin, please, within that component?  Interesting questions
   0.00  1 On the first, I think the confidence in a steady performance from BI comes from the fact that we have good visibility now on where we are on renewals and on contract value across all of the markets we're in and the renewal period is -- runs really from -- straddles the calendar year, it runs from November through to February
   0.00  1 The less confidence in how punchy or strong that will be is because, as I was saying in my opening remarks, really, what will now lift that business from a steady growth performer, and there's no shame or disappointment in that, but into a strong growth performer is new business and that's about pipeline   and conversion
   0.20 -1 And indeed, the profitability of that pipeline and conversion, that's much harder to track and see at this stage of the year
  -0.20  0 In AP, I mean, this is a subject that I don't profess to be an expert
  -0.04  0 But there is no doubt that we've discussed this before, you and I, the fundamental truth of research and scholarly publishing is that everybody engaged in that activity has one common goal, and that is to ensure the dissemination and sharing of high-quality, original research output on the grounds that it broadens the sum of human knowledge
   0.25  0 If you increase learning, you increase innovation
  -0.08  0 That's the driving force of the activity that we're all engaged with, which is why academic publishers to be good academic publishers have to be as interested in academia as they are in publishing
   0.00  1 It's a very interesting market to work in
   0.12  0 And that's why we've progressively made investment both in our own Open Access business
  -0.05  0 And generally speaking, my experience is, if you're in a market, if you're got brands, product and quality content and the market is expanding, it's incumbent upon you to find a way of developing your product and service to take advantage of that not just defend where you are
  -0.11  0 And that's what we're in the process of doing, and that's a large part to go back to Katherine's question of what Annie's charge is over the next 3 to 4 years
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of questions
  -0.25  0 Second question was just on the synergies with UBM
  -0.25  0 And then final question, a little bit reflective
   0.15  0 I think you talked about sort of the next plan being the sort of Accelerated Integration Plan, but integration isn't necessarily a strategy
  -0.17  0 You might want to come in on the procurement question, Gareth
   0.08  0 What we do in order to smooth out the lumps to use your word in Books and what we've been doing, and that's why I used it in my presentation is we've simplified our own operating business
   0.08  0 But ultimately, I'll be standing here in November of next year and you'll be saying to me, "What's your confidence in your Books numbers for 2018?" I'll be saying, "Ask me in January." That's the truth of that business
   0.00  1 And I think we feel, going into '18, good about the midterm prospects
   0.00  1 And as the auditor is sitting just one row behind you, I need to limit anything further that I say on that, other than that number has been verified and we feel confident in that
   0.00  1 And we want to deliver that in our existing business in '18, and that's I think a good strategy for this year
  -0.13  0 I think you asked an interesting question about where long term the future of the combined group is, but I think we need to become a combined group before we answer that question publicly
  -0.22  0 A key aspect of that was getting their contractor services contracts for the build of their exhibitions onto the [indiscernible] contract
   0.00  1 And we had a larger scale business, therefore, we're able to use some leverage to get a better contract in that space
   0.00  1 So that was the largest part of the Penton savings, along with things about insurance, commissions, property, et cetera, that also helped
   0.00  1 As Stephen said, it's a number that we would hope to beat
  -0.50  0 Question at the front
   0.00  1 But just to pin down the Books business in the fourth quarter of last year, obviously a big acceleration from 0.9% in Academic to 2.0% the whole year
   0.12  0 Or was there any sort of channel effects or anything that was unusual in that fourth quarter performance because it obviously was a big acceleration
   0.00  1 The answer is, it was, look, it was a strong
  -0.09  0 And given that we are having this conversation in February, if I'm allowed to say this with you, Richard, we've seen -- we haven't seen a dry January because of a bumper December, if that's your question
   0.00  1 Well, can I thank you again for those people who are in the room
   0.11  0 And I hope that some UBM colleagues also found it a useful insight into the business that hopefully they will be coming a very central part of
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

   0.00  1 We delivered another strong year of performance in 2017
   0.00  1 Solid RevPAR increases in the U.S
   0.00  1 and globally, as well as a 4% net system size growth, our best since 2009, drove underlying fee revenue up 5%
  -0.20  0 I also talked about my intention to work our model harder in the future
   0.10  0 In order to fund these plans, we are undertaking a comprehensive company-wide efficiency program, which we started in August of 2017
   0.00  1 The program will release $125 million in annual savings across IHG's P&L and system fund for reinvestment by the end of 2020
   0.00  1  Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 This   allowed us to increase our fee margin by 140 basis points year-on-year whilst continuing to invest for growth
  -0.06  1 Interest charges fell by $2 million due to the impact of the weaker pound, a reduction on our bonds coupon following our refinancing in 2016, offset by higher average net debt levels during the year
   0.00 -1 Our reported tax rate stayed at 30% and we expect that to come down for 2018 due to U.S
   0.09  0 The weighted average numbers of shares decreased by 9% due to the cumulative effect of a share consolidations following the special dividend payments made in May 2016 and May 2017
  -0.08  0 At the same time as adding these new high-quality representations of our brands, we remain focused on removing underperforming properties, exiting 17,000 rooms
   0.00  1 This brought net system size growth to 4%, our best performance in 8 years
   0.00  1 Combined with RevPAR growth of 2.7%, this drove total underlying fee revenue up 5%
   0.09  0 I am aware it contains a lot of information, but I thought it would help to explain our underlying performance more clearly
   0.00  1 The drivers of our fee-based model are well-understood
   0.00  1 Standard industry metrics of annual rooms growth and comparable RevPAR growth are good properties to understand how this translates into incremental fee revenue over time
   0.00  1 The faster we expand in developing markets in these regions, the more we will see this dynamic in our fee revenue growth
   0.00  1 In the long time -- in the long term, as these markets mature, they will support sustained RevPAR growth
   0.00 -1 By 2017, these hotels will have been fully operationally ramped up, and we can see that, as expected, the absolute RevPAR generated by the developing market cohort was significantly lower than those in the more established markets
   0.00  1 And as these markets continue to mature, we would expect them to drive even more RevPAR growth, demonstrating their long-term viability and value
  -0.12  0 Before I do so, you may have seen that on the 17th of April, we will be issuing restated comparatives to reflect some changes to our reporting from the 1st of January, 2018
   0.00  1 industry demand has been at record levels for 80 of the last 82 months
   0.00  1 Consequently, our hotels in the region are continuing to drive record occupancies of nearly 70%
   0.00  1 This meant predominantly rate-driven RevPAR increases, with the Americas up 1.6% and the U.S
   0.00  1 was up 3% with continued noise from the ongoing impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the shift in timing of Jewish observances into September
   0.00  1 performance marked a significant step-up from that in the third quarter
  -0.05  1 Good growth in royalty revenue was partly offset by the impact of the financial incentives associated with our Crowne Plaza Accelerate program, the annualized cost of up-weighting our development resource and the delayed payroll tax credit, which we now expect to recognize in 2018
   0.00  1 Underlying managed profit was up 11%, although this is a little misleading
  -0.08  0 Our calculation of underlying is designed to normalize the year-on-year foreign exchange movements by restating our results at the prior year FX rate
   0.00  1 Regional overheads benefited from lower-than-anticipated claims in our U.S
   0.00 -1 It is pleasing to note that as we had expected, our avid signings do not appear to be slowing the growth in Express
   0.00  1 Moving now to Europe, where RevPAR was up 6.3% for the year
  -0.08  1 In the U.K., RevPAR was up almost 5% in both London and the provinces, with some slowing of growth in the capital in the fourth quarter due to strong comparables and a reduction in U.S
   0.33  0 inbound travels as the pound strengthened against the dollar
   0.00  1 In France, RevPAR was up 7% with double-digit growth in Paris as demand continued to recover following the terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016
   0.00  1 We opened 5,000 rooms and signed a further 9,000, almost half of which were in Germany, marking our fourth record year of signings in Europe's second-largest lodging market
   0.00  1 Looking now at our Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, where RevPAR was up 1.5%
   0.00  1 Performance in the rest of the region was strong with RevPAR up 4%
   0.00  1 We opened a record 11,000 rooms, including 3,500 rooms in Makkah, Saudi Arabia
  -0.11  1 Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities were also strong, driven by good meetings business and helped by some weak comparables in the second half
   0.00  1   The combination of strong RevPAR and net rooms growth increased underlying revenue by 9%
   0.00  1 Room openings totaled a record 11,000, taking our system size in the region to over 100,000 rooms and 300 hotels
   0.00  1 Demand for this new format continues to be strong, with 54 signings during 2017
   0.00  1 Total signings for the region of 24,000 rooms represents our best in 10 years, taking the total signs in the past 3 years to more than 62,000 rooms
  -0.10  0 tax bill also resulted in a one-off exceptional credit to the P&L of $108 million in 2017, most of which relates to the rebasing of our deferred tax liabilities
   0.00 -1 So our steps to date have had a big impact
   0.12 -1 But the reality is that in this business, there's a requirement to invest ahead of profit delivery
   0.10  0 And we are focused on ensuring that such investments for the medium term does not lead to an erosion of short-term profitability
  -0.20  0 To deliver this, we are implementing a significant restructure of the group
   0.00  1 This will realize -- this will release $125 million of additional capacity for reinvestment into our strategic initiatives across IHG's P&L and the system fund by 2020
   0.06  0 Looking at the efficiency program on a more granular basis, we expect $50 million of the capacity for reinvestment come from savings in our P&L with the remaining $75 million from savings in the system fund
   0.00  1 Our business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash, with underlying free cash flow in 2017 of $516 million
   0.07  0 This was broadly flat year-on-year after adjusting in 2016 for the $95 million receipt related to credit card partnership agreements and the $31 million cost incurred in relation to our efficiency program
   0.09  0 We intend to fully spend the remaining surplus in 2018 with the balance included within the exceptional cash cost associated with our efficiency program
   0.00  1 As well as using cash to reinvest behind our long term, we want to generate sufficient funds to support growth in the ordinary dividend
   0.00  1 We have announced today that the 2017 final dividend will increase by 11% to $0.71 per share
   0.00  1 This brings the total dividend for 2017 to $1.04 per share, also up 11%, and takes the total return to shareholders to $13 billion, 40% of which has been generated from operational cash flows
   0.00  1 Lastly, whether it's further cash available, which is deemed through the surplus, we will return this to shareholders as we have demonstrated over the past 14 years
   0.00  1 The costs we will incur to achieve this in 2018 means that the surplus fund we will have available will not be of a quantum that would justify paying an additional capital return to shareholders this calendar year but we remain committed to doing so in the future
   0.25  0 The success of our strategy to date has been borne out in our financial results
   0.00  1 We've grown our rooms asset in the industry, driven double-digit fee revenue growth and increased earnings per share more than 50% over the past 3 years
   0.00 -1 We know that we must continue this strong performance for years to come
   0.00  1 Our sector is as dynamic and fast changing as ever and it's supported by significant tailwinds that will drive up demand for hotels over the next few decades
  -1.00  0 And having scale is crucial
  -0.06  1 The big 5 branded global players, of which IHG is one, now have 24% of the world's rooms, and crucially, 60% of the active pipeline, meaning they will collectively continue to take share and increase their relative scale against the rest of the industry
   0.00  1 When it comes to hotel owners, big branded players are appealing for several reasons
   0.00  1 They have the scale and the resources to provide operational support, the specialist expertise and technology solutions required to deliver low-cost revenue to hotels and the capacity and capability to maintain and grow a compelling portfolio of brands
   0.00  1 You'll recognize our model here on the slide, which we have evolved and fine-tuned as we look to accelerate our growth and at which I mentioned earlier, maps across to each of our strategic initiatives
   0.20  0 Back in September 2017, we announced several changes to our operating structure, which became effective on the 1st of January this year
   0.08  0 Firstly, within our regional operations, we brought together 2 of our current divisions, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa, whilst leaving Greater China and the America regions largely unchanged
   0.00  1 This structure allows us to focus on those markets that matter most whilst leveraging best practices to drive growth
   0.22  0 Kenneth Macpherson, previously our CEO for Greater China, leads the new EMEAA region based out of the U.K
   0.12  0 It compresses more than 60% of our open rooms and 45% of our pipeline and delivers almost 3/4 of group operating profit
   0.00  1 We've delivered double-digit growth there in the past 3 years, and this momentum looks set to continue
   0.00  1 It's a $190 billion market expected to grow by almost 50% over the next 8 years
   0.00  1 The Chinese hospitality industry is set to grow by 60% in the next 8 years and we'll take a considerable   share of that with 21% of the active industry pipeline
   0.14  0 It represents around 1/4 of our rooms and pipeline and contributes 20% of the group's profits
   0.00  1 The size of the overall EMEAA market, as well as its future growth potential, is actually larger than that of the Americas
   0.00  1 In what is a highly fragmented region, accessing this growth means up-weighting our investments in those individual submarkets that matter the most to IHG, both in terms of overall value but also where we can leverage our scale to accelerate our growth
   0.27  0 We've also created a new integrated commercial and technology organization under the leadership of Eric Pearson, who was previously our Chief Information Officer
   0.00  1 He has extensive experience across the marketing and digital, so is uniquely qualified for the job
   0.00  1 This change brings together our sales, channels, revenue management and technology capabilities into one function, maximizing revenue delivery into our hotels
   0.00  1 Claire has a proven track record of running marketing functions across B2B and B2C businesses and has a strong understanding of the travel sector from her time with American Express
   0.00  1 We worked hard to shape and evolve our brands in recent years to make sure they're fit and ready for future growth
   0.00  1 And as you can see from today's results, they performed well and driven strong performance across the group
  -0.17  0 The changes we're making are not limited to commercial, tech and marketing
   0.00  1 The executive committee has worked together across the whole organization, is structured in a way that best supports our growth plans while freeing up capacity for reinvestment to drive growth
   0.29  0 Moving on to IHG Rewards Club, which is one of our greatest assets
   0.15  0 In 2016, we started to roll a member-exclusive preferential rate, Your Rate by IHG Rewards Club, which members receive when booking through our direct channels
   0.00  1 We completed the rollout during last year, and in the 12 months after launch, we drove direct channel growth up more than 3 points and the retail segment growth up 2 points
   0.00  1 On average, IHG delivers 76% of rooms revenue to our hotels in our system, up 5 percentage points over the last 3 years
   0.00  1 And we've more than doubled mobile revenue in the last 3 years to over $2 billion today
   0.00  1 This is making a significant difference to our guests, driving Guest Internet Love up by 5 points
   0.00 -1 Secondly, owners want low operational costs
   0.00  1 Finally, owners want high-quality, low-cost revenue generation
   0.00  1 These 3 elements together provide an end-to-end solution which generates high returns and drives asset values for our owners
   0.00  1 This is an area we have focused on heavily in recent years and which has helped drive our net system growth from 2% in 2013 to 4% in 2017
   0.00  1 There is also a significant potential for us to expand our franchise offer into new markets and brands
   0.11  0 We launched Franchise Plus for Holiday Inn Express in Greater China in May of 2016 and have since signed up 74 hotels to the new format, including 54 in 2017
   0.00  1 We expect this strong momentum to continue into 2018
   0.00  1 This will allow us to further accelerate its growth, both within its home U.S
   0.05  0 As I touched on earlier, we have evolved the marketing function so that we now have one comprehensive global approach led by our new Chief Marketing Officer and category leads who are responsible for the performance of the entire category of brands
   0.17  0 We now have one central team that brings together everything relevant to our brands: positioning, pricing and priorities
   0.14  0 And then I'll touch on the opportunities we seek to augment our portfolio
   0.00  1 Holiday Inn is an iconic brand built over 60 years
   0.00  1 It is the industry leader in full-service mid-scale with over 1,200 open hotels
   0.00 -1 Moving on to Holiday Inn Express, which was launched in 1991 and is now the industry's largest brand, with 2,600 hotels open and a further 766 in the pipeline, it is a real category killer
   0.25  0 I talked at some length about our new innovations for this brand at our results in August
   0.00  1 Breakfast is a key differentiator in the limited service space and our new offering provides higher-quality food options at a better cost for owners
   0.00  1 We have a strong and growing presence in this space
   0.00  1 We've more than tripled the size of our U.S.-focused Candlewood Suites brand, since we acquired it in 2004, demonstrating the power of IHG systems and our ability to plug-in new brands and drive their growth
  -0.50  0 But we're not stopping here
   0.10  0 We're now looking to take some of the design innovations that we've originally developed in the U.S
   0.00  1 Plaza Workspace, our technology-enabled public spaces designed for solo work and for small groups, this drives incremental revenue for our owners from previously underutilized hotel space
   0.20  0 And after a successful trial in the Americas, they'll be launched in all regions during 2018
   0.14  0 HUALUXE is a brand close to my heart as I was heavily involved in the 2012 launch when I headed up the Greater China region
   0.00  1 The culture has changed significantly in recent years, so we've taken and had to adapt the brand to ensure it remains competitive and appealing   to both guests and owners in the future
   0.00  1 EVEN Hotels and Hotel Indigo appeal to guests wanting a more personalized experience
   0.00  1 We're also gaining momentum internationally, having launched the brand outside the U.S
   0.11  0 This is part of a multi-unit agreement with our great partners, Pro Invest, to build 10 or 15 hotels for the brand across Australia and New Zealand
   0.14  0 We also signed 3 EVEN hotels in Greater China, with properties set to open over the next few years in Shanghai, Sanya and Jinan
  -0.12  0 We opened 8 hotels in 2017, including a stunning property in Los Angeles with 72 floors and a rooftop bar
   0.00  1 InterContinental continues to receive industry accolades, including jumping up 64 places in the Nunwood Customer Experience ranking in the U.S
  -0.17  0 Since purchasing Kimpton at the end of 2014, one of our key objectives has been to take the brand global
   0.20  0 The brand will soon make its debut in Asia and Greater China with signings in Bali, Shanghai, Sanya and Taiwan in 2017
   0.22  0 This is particularly the case for their unrivaled food and beverage expertise, which we're now using to inform many of our innovations across our other brands
   0.11  0 And earlier this year, we completed the integration of Kimpton's loyalty program, Karma, into IHG Rewards Club, bringing together breadth of hotel options and redemption possibilities for members of both programs
   0.17  0 We have always done this in a highly-targeted, rigorous and insights-driven way
   0.00  1 This includes tapping into those segments that are both already high in value and have significant potential for growth
   0.25 -1 We must be able to deliver superior revenue at price premium
   0.17  0 But first, I'm going to touch on the other opportunities we've identified
   0.00  1 The first is the $40 billion upscale segment, which is expected to grow by 50% over the next 10 years
   0.00  1 Our guest research has highlighted that many consumers are looking for something other than traditional, big-box upscale hotels; they want a more unique experience
   0.00  1 This will offer a new guest proposition, which delivers a strong visual identity through a focused set of high-value brand standards, which, from an owner's perspective, requires a limited upfront capital outlay and are efficient to operate
   0.00  1 It also gives us the opportunity to build our presence at a higher price point and meet the demands of high-value consumers, whose needs our current portfolio brands doesn't quite capture
   0.00  1 By creating this bespoke and dedicated division, we'll be bringing together some of the most experienced and respected people in the industry across branding, luxury, operations, design, development and customer experience
   0.00  1 Collectively, they will help us drive our offer ensuring that our existing luxury brands continue to evolve and allowing us to rejuvenate any new brands that we acquire in the future
   0.08  0 On that point, we are currently looking to acquire 1 or 2 small, luxury, asset-light brands that we would incubate and grow in order to access these significant opportunities
   0.11  0 Our consumer insight showed that 14 million guests spend $20 billion in annual industry revenues in this segment in the U.S
   0.00  1 They are traveling for both business and leisure and they're looking for consistency, a clean, safe environment and good value
  -0.25  0 In turn, we can justify a royalty rate of 5%
   0.00  1 The demand for this compelling offer is clear
   0.00  1 We have the right strategy and we are committed to making our model work harder
   0.10  0 We are reorganizing the company to create efficiencies, which we will reinvest behind the new strategic initiatives we've announced today
  -0.07  0 Just maybe starting with the position to cut quite a bit of cost and reinvest that, it's not something your [ others ] or big asset-light peers have done recently
   0.33  0 And so today, industry-leading is 5.5% to 6.5%
  -0.25  0 I guess the question is the spend kind of underinvestment
   0.33  0 This is effectively just a reallocation of resources
  -0.14  0 And actually, you look at what Marriott did a few years ago, they did take out quite a lot of cost from SG&A and they put it into their development function, quite a significant amount
   0.08  0    Well, it's hard to predict exactly year-on-year and I think we said in 2017 that we wanted to see progression and I think that the 4% that we've delivered, we were happier with that
  -0.17  0 Second question, your guidance seems to be you can continue to grow margin at 135 basis points a year
   0.00 -1 You're taking out more central costs, so it doesn't look like you'll be able to drive it from there
   0.00  1 So can you maybe talk about where does margin expansion come from in the regions, if not centrally? And then the third one, something you didn't touch on, but it's in your release is that you've grown your credit card sales by 14.5%
  -0.12  0 If my maths are right, you're getting about $125 million, somewhere about that, maybe I've got that wrong, of revenue from that
   0.00  1 So making sure going forward that when we have surplus cash, we'll return to shareholders but of a sizable nature that makes sense to do it
   0.14  0 So it would be better to wait until it's of a significant magnitude, more significant magnitude and then raise it then
   0.00  1 In terms of your question on guidance, I think we've done a pretty good job over the last 13 years, on average 135 basis points accretion to margin and there's lots of things that we have done in terms of using procurement better in terms of zero-based budgeting, in terms of offshoring, outsourcing, et cetera,   and there's more that we can do there even after this program
   0.00  1 So we do believe that going forward, post this, there's still an ability how to drive margin
   0.00  1 Part of it is helped by the fact that our business -- in a franchising environment, as you're bringing more revenue, you don't actually a lot more cost that comes in, so there's natural margin accretion that comes in there together with the very strong discipline we have around costs
   0.00  1  Yes, I mean, so clearly, we're continuing to grow and accelerate the credit card offer that we have with the co-brand and looking to expand that co-brand offer going forward
  -0.33  0 And then just also kind of back to Jamie's question of that
   0.00  1 I mean you want to accelerate growth
  -0.08  0 How are you going to make sure that the quality of the pipeline is strong, especially if the downturn does or doesn't come over the next few years?  Again, I'll take those in reverse order
   0.00  1 I mean this not just about short-term gains; this is about long-term sustainable growth and building high quality brands
   0.05  0 And the focus of how we're building out the brand standards, high-quality hotels, great brand experience is core to who we are and we wouldn't put Guest Love up there every year and talk about the movement in that metric if we weren't committed to building quality brands
   0.00 -1    Yes, I guess, there are positives and negatives, I guess, you could say
   0.00  1 Equally, a lot of our brands are very -- they're lower labor cost brands
  -0.14  0 Second question, just coming back to the sort of acceleration of growth and your comments about margins
  -0.17  0 And then the final question was just you talked about evolving the proposition for Kimpton
  -0.25  0 So we're not having to break ground and build
   0.00  1 In terms of the fee structure, long term, we've been -- maintained a fairly consistent fee structure across all of our brands because of the value of the system
   0.12  0 I think in margin enhancement, to Paul's point, it's the model, fundamentally
   0.00 -1 I mean with a large scale business and a big franchise business, as that gets bigger, you just get the natural drop through in terms of margin enhancement overall
   0.00  1 So it's really different owner offers and different models and to figure out how we could -- and we have a very clear vision
   0.00  1 It's an exceptional brand
   0.00  1 It is just how do we -- again, the fundamental premise we have as an executive team now is leveraging all of our assets which are our brands and how do we accelerate our growth with those, again in a sustainable way
   0.40  0 And so thinking creatively about Kimpton now that we understand it better
  -1.00  0 Three questions from me
  -0.04  0 RevPAR, have you seen any change in international demand on the back of the weaker dollar?  So in terms of acquisition of luxury brands, the way we think about it, there are probably 3 distinct ways you can build a luxury brand from 0, so you can decide that you're going to build their brand concept and then buy some assets or -- and that's pretty capital-intensive and slow
   0.00  1 The other way is to go out and buy a very big luxury brand company which wouldn't be consistent with what we've strategically done over time and so we are very focused on the sweet spot of acquiring an asset-light, small luxury brand company or companies with a strong customer proposition, strong owner proposition that we can grow
   0.00 -1 Lots of noise in Q4, though, let's be candid about it
   0.00 -1 You still have the impacts of the hurricanes
   0.00  1 So you're definitely seeing more momentum in the U.S
   0.00 -1 So a much bigger pool to go fishing in for Europe and also a lot more pricing pressure on distribution costs in Europe than in the U.S
   0.00  1 Also, I have a team here that actually is entitled to doing avid hotel, so we have the ability and the bandwidth
   0.00  1 And we're going to be regularly updating GRS with more and more functionality and that's what's going to drive the real revenue uplifts over time
  -0.22  0 Just a quick question, a broad question about owners and franchisees, how they're feeling at this point in the cycle
   0.00  1 So we had a record year for signing for Holiday Inn Express whilst signing 75 avid hotels
   0.00 -1 So I think that proved our point that there was going to be little to 0 cannibalization between those 2 brands
   0.00  1 It works on a different footprint in terms of land and different cost per key, so it's really accretive
   0.14  0 Similarly, we're seeing and having conversations about the conversion brand opportunity, we've been already speaking to owners and they are existing owners
   0.00  1 And that's the thing about leveraging our scale of our ownership base is when we come up with a new product, we have the ability to kind of deploy it against all those different owner customer segments as well, too
  -0.33  0 Just a quick question on acquisitions
  -0.04  0 Aside from the current focus of 1 or 2 much more luxury brands, could you elaborate on your acquisition strategy more generally on financing preferences and how is it for your leverage target priority?  I mean, the way we thought about this business over an extended period of time in our strategy, I think we've been consistent, and if not, a broken record about it
   0.00  1 And that the fastest way to grow this business in an asset-light strategy is through by developing organic brands
   0.00  1 Right now out there, how would you say asset prices are right now, Paul?  Yes, it's very high
   0.05  0    Yes, I mean right now, multiples are significantly high, at this point in the cycle, so we're focusing on using our capacity to invest in ones with the highest growth areas that are aligned to creating value for our shareholders
   0.00  1 Because we can do that in a very, very thoughtful way
  -1.00  0 Two questions
  -0.05  0 And secondly, looking at the dividend policy, how should we view the disconnect between EPS growth and the dividend growth this morning?  In terms of the to-do list, yes, there is quite a lot that we're saying that we're doing
   0.00 -1 And I think it's when you go into something you don't know about, that tends to be higher risk
   0.00  1 In the mainstream we're already the leader there
   0.00  1  Thanks, everyone
   0.00  1 So appreciate your time

   0.00  1                                                                    All right, good morning, everybody
  -0.17  0 The board and the management has been giving a lot of thought to the Brexit implications
  -0.10  0 As far the shareholders' return is concerned, as a result of the 3 quarter in 2017 was -- were presented, we did announce an interim dividend of EUR 0.125 per share
   0.12  0 And I am pleased to announce that the board was recommended, is going to recommend a final dividend of EUR 0.145 per share
   0.00  1 Altogether, these make a total dividend of EUR 0.27 per share, which means 15% higher than the one of last year's and is pretty much in line with the growth of the underlying [ EBIT ]
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
  -0.14  0 We were at the beginning of last year doubtful about the moment where we were going to be getting to breakeven in terms of unit revenues
   0.00  1 And you will see our Q4 figures in terms of unit revenues have been strong, very strong [indiscernible]
   0.00  1 So it's also showed through a combination of capacity growth and passenger revenue growth
   0.00  1 RPKs figures have been growing by 3.8%
   0.25 -1 And this 2.1% has been very much related to some one-off and some type of consequences of our success
   0.05  0 And I'll be going through those type of negative impacts later on in this presentation, but they are very much related, and I advance these concepts to you, with a significant swing in variable awards and bonuses for employees that are strictly related to the success in the performance of the business through this year
  -0.05  1 We are also providing for some type of legal litigations and settlements that we are basically confirming through Q4, but I think a very significant message is the underlying trends in unit -- in nonfuel unit costs keep on being appropriate, keep on being favorable
   0.12 -1 We've been reducing slightly the figure of operating profits for Q4 in respect of last year
   0.11  0 And it's basically very much related to the, I would say, bonus effect that we will be commenting later on
   0.00 -1 It's also been affecting our leisure traffics as well
   0.12 -1 As I was explaining to you, Q4 operating profit has been reduced by EUR 35 million in respect of '16 figures
   0.00  1 Also about passenger revenues, we have had a strong performance of cargo revenues specifically, and that's something that is flowing into year 2018 as well
  -0.08  0 So ex fuel costs, of course the capacity drag and then very significantly the bonus impact that I'll explain briefly to you
   0.11 -1 So last year, '16, on top of post-Brexit environment last quarter of the year, most of the companies of the group realized they were not going to be able to achieve their targets
   0.10  0 And then the winding of the accruals that were made through the rest of the quarters of the year, which reduced the base of Q4 '16 -- it's easy to explain
   0.00  1 And the swing between the 2 years then, it's very remarkable
   0.00  1 So employee costs through '16 and '17 have been reduced in [ unit terms ]
   0.00  1 And that's a very important [ sign ]
   0.00  1 So   we'll get some more details afterwards, but it's good to envisage how both the premium, very strong premium traffic, but also the nonpremium and the long haul have been helping us in this in revenue increase
   0.00  1 In the short haul, again strong performance for British Airways and Iberia
  -0.12  0 Even the negatives that we have seen here in domestic has very much to do with capacity increase and stage length increase
   0.00  1 So this has very much to do with growth both from Iberia and Vueling from the peninsula, into the Canary Islands, a very long-stage-length leg, which naturally and mathematically reduces unit revenues
   0.00  1 But having said that, North America had a significant 2.8% increase
   0.00  1 And just to give you a little bit more of flavor: The performance of British Airways has been above 5%, very much aligned with the performance that you may have heard from the U.S
    nan  1 carriers, above its 5%
   0.00 -1 Of course, this is averaged down by LEVEL or even by Iberia, but even Aer Lingus has had a flattish performance in North Atlantic with a capacity increase of double-digit figures
   0.00  1 So it shows North Atlantic is working very favorable for the group in terms of revenues but also in terms of contribution as well [indiscernible]
    nan  1 Latin America has been the star in this quarter
   0.00  1 So the picture is good not only because of specific regions being strong but also across-the-board pattern
   0.00  1 And this is where you see the specific bonus swing affecting mostly to British Airways and Vueling; and being responsible for, I guess, most or very significant part of this plus 3.2% increase that we are seeing in the quarter
   0.00  1 So our growth in terms of passengers and selling costs are passenger driven
   0.00  1 It's significantly higher than the growth in terms of ASK, so that's basically behind these increases in selling costs that are having a parallel increase already in revenues
  -0.33  0 They have to do with litigations, settlements and provisions
  -0.10  0 It's basically having to do with [ an issue with ] executive-class litigation on fuel surcharges on one side
  -0.12  0 It's having to do also with a VAT litigation with Spanish authorities on international flights
   0.00  1 So again the message today is that what we are seeing is the underlying nonfuel unit costs that we want to keep coming lower on a year-to-year basis and that we have done so
   0.00  1 Remember that, from the beginning, from the launching of our project, of our IAG project, we have been able to reduce nonfuel   costs in 7 years by [ 10% ]
   0.00 -1 Basically, in euro terms there's going to be a very light reduction in quarter 1, also minor in quarter 2
   0.00  1 We are, I would say, focusing on our hedging instruments, especially focusing on the way we can obtain additional revenues, and we are convinced we will
   0.00  1 So 16.0%, so this is record figure
   0.00  1 It's record figure for the group
   0.00  1 The figures that you are going to be seeing in the next couple of slides are record figures for each of the companies in the group
   0.50  0 So it's about 1/3 of improvement or 30%
   0.00  1 So really the performance of the group has been very important, very significant work [indiscernible]
   0.00  1 Below the line, we are disclosing an improvement of 14% in underlying EPS
   0.00  1 So that's totally dilutive and pre-exceptional and which we'll be translating into a growth on dividend per share of 16%
  -0.40  0 Relevant there then, I would say, gains and losses on disposals
  -0.12  1 So last year, we had a capital gain, a remarkable capital gain, on British Airways on the disposal of our A319 fleet
   0.00 -1 We are going to probably reduce very significantly the volatility that we will be recognizing below, I would say, the operating profit because of this concept
   0.00  1 So hopefully, we will be able to reduce up to some [ stages ] this volatility below the operating profit line
   0.25  0 Effective tax rate of around 19% this year, very much in line with last year
   0.00  1 So on balance sheet, net debt is now EUR 655 million, again showing a very strong balance sheet
  -0.08  0 And this is, of course, before what we intend to do in terms of this new share buyback, EUR 500 million, that we've announced the intention of the company, the group to execute [ through FY '19 ]
  -0.10  0 Again, on the top of the chart, we are showing how we have been retributing, how we have been giving back cash to shareholders both upon the results of '16 and then upon the results of '17, what we intend to do
  -0.08  0 This year, we are proposing a final dividend of EUR 0.145 per share, subject of course to the approval of the general shareholder assembly; and a share buyback program of EUR 500 million
   0.00  1 And that, we can do so because we will be generating, we have been generating significant amounts of cash
   0.00 -1 This year has been benign
   0.00  1 But again, I would say, very comfortable in terms of coverage of our future share and -- buyback and share dividend [ commitment ]
   0.00  1 And then this is again good news
  -0.10  0 As you know, because we've been public about it, British Airways team has been engaged since the beginning of last year working on a new pension fund scheme that could represent a reduction in the exposure and the vulnerability, financial vulnerability, of their balance sheet and their accounts
   0.08  0 So this means basically closing for [ our ] future accruals the famous NAPS scheme; and integrating the BARP scheme, which is a -- it is already a defined contribution model
   0.07  0 So there has been a very, very intense work being done to convince unions, to convince employees to transmit information, to put the systems ready in the company, to engage the employees into the new system
   0.07  0 So that means that, since the beginning of April, cross fingers, hopefully, we'll be able to open a new defined benefit -- defined contribution, sorry, scheme for all the employees both engaged in NAPS and BARP
  -0.08  1 And that will have positive implications in terms of exposure, in terms of vulnerability into the future and that we have a reflection in both balance sheet and profit and loss account
   0.10  0 So that's something that probably we will be getting more information through March and we'll be ready to explain and transmit and share with you once it's [ final ]
   0.00  1 I think 2017 was a very good year, and we're building on that for 2018
    nan  1 And so 2017 was a good year
   0.08  0 And it is a base effect here because Iberia had 2 aircraft grounded in Q4 of last year for retrofit, putting in the new [ products ] in the premium economy in the aircraft
   0.00  1 And LEVEL obviously will continue its growth
   0.00  1 In fact, there's quite a lot of opportunities in the future for Aer Lingus
   0.00 -1 We believe we spread ourselves too thin during 2015 and 2016 as we went through growth there
   0.00  1 So we believe this is very sensible
   0.00  1 I've said before I think we are unique
   0.00  1 We're flexible
   0.00  1 Our structure is unique
   0.00  1 And I'll point to some of these issues in a second, but what we get is a financial performance that in 2017 exceeded our targets
   0.00  1 And Enrique mentioned that return on invested capital of 16%, above our 15% target; lease-adjusted margin 14.4% and the range 12% to 15% that we've highlighted investing in accretive organic growth
   0.25  0 We're always open to the opportunity for inorganic
  -0.09  0 And as the Chairman mentioned in his opening comments, we announced our intention to complete a EUR 500 million share buyback in 2018, similar to the 2017 share buyback
  -0.25  0 The only question we've had in the past is how we return that
   0.00  1 And clearly, we believe that share buyback is the right thing to do
   0.00  1 That was well executed
  -0.12  1 In constant currency terms, you've seen our ex fuel unit costs decline by 10.3%
   0.00  1 There are times when we have to address some cost issues and invest, but we have a clearer path through the next 5 years of our plan that will see us reduce our unit costs further
   0.17  0 Vueling has an ongoing focus on their cost efficiency
   0.00  1 And Aer Lingus will continue doing what they've done and doing it extremely well
  -0.33  1 And this is well in excess of anything that our competitors have done
   0.33 -1 And we have great competition for our capital
   0.00  1 We learned a lot from that
   0.14  0 Our plan in the short term sees us getting to about 15 aircraft but with the opportunity to build on that
   0.14  0 The 5 aircraft, the 3 additional aircraft will also be Airbus A330-200s, but we do have opportunities to switch to the 787
   0.00  1 So LEVEL, as I said, has exceeded our expectations in terms [ of performance ]
   0.00  1 We think there is a strong economic case to be made for Heathrow but only if the [ cost is right ]
   0.00  1 They've made lots of nice promises
   0.33  0 We think there is an opportunity at Heathrow
   0.12 -1 They don't have the incentive to do this in an efficient way because, as you know, the regulatory structure has rewarded their inefficiency
  -0.12  1 And therefore, we will continue to argue very strongly our case that this should only proceed if there is a hard commitment to maintaining passenger charges
   0.08  0 We're not in any way impressed by language that, "We're trying to keep them close to the existing charges." That's not good enough, and we believe it can be expanded without any increase
   0.33  0 So if it's efficient, we will work with them
   0.00 -1 I take comfort from the fact that John Holland-Kaye is obsessed with the comments that I've made
  -0.23  1 To quote Oscar Wilde: He said that "Whenever people agree with me, I always think I must be wrong, but the fact that they're disagreeing with me means I'm right." And we will continue to argue the case very strongly
   0.12  0 We are evaluating all of the changes that we believe can be considered to ensure that all of our airlines within the group [ continue to profit ]
   0.14  0 And clearly, we're flexible in terms of adapting those structures [ effective ]
   0.00  1 [indiscernible] been very good discussions with the regulators
   0.00  1 We've got a good relationship with all of the relevant [ regulators ]
   0.17  0 That   provide our shareholder the assurances that our shareholders need and demand
  -0.11  0 And I think that others don't get that we're not going to pursue capacity growth that is ill disciplined
   0.00  1 Capacity growth [ will be simply ] very, very sensible
    nan  1 We have strong brands that we have
  -0.50  0 We're now ready for questions
   1.00  0 Three, please
   0.50  0 Any numbers on that would be great
   0.12 -1 I was wondering if you could say that would absolutely be down still if you took out the benefits of the potential pension change at BA
  -0.08  0 What are you seeing internally in terms of NPS, in terms of your own view of what the customers are saying, either for you or Alex?  Let Enrique address the first 2 questions and then I'll jump in
   0.00  1 It's growing and it has to grow
  -0.10  0 Of course, we'll be able to disclose impact of new pension fund schemes [indiscernible] [ this year ] was later on
   0.00  1 For example, we are, as you know, considering some of our labor costs has been exceptional, both in British Airways and Iberia because they are basically attending these famous 2 projects
  -0.17  0 I think it is important to say that we still have a deficit, which needs to be managed
  -0.13  0 So that the deficit doesn't disappear if the trustees [indiscernible] -- the trustees, we've got to consult with the trustees, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here
   0.17 -1 I would still expect the nonfuel unit costs for BA to be down next year even without the pension benefit going through
  -0.25  0 So, that's the direct answer to the question, James
  -0.20  0 So that's one of the reasons the restructuring program went into 2018
   0.00 -1 I mean we knew there would be
   0.00 -1 We knew what the impact would be
   0.00 -1 We knew what was happening there
   0.00  1 Part of the issue in relation to the bonus that Enrique spoke about and what we're seeing so far this year is very, very good
   0.00  1 The only detail I would give you is, as we go to market with new features, product features, call it the new economy class, long haul, catering, as we roll out the Club World catering and bedding, we see specifically and very visibly increases to NPS
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.20  0  So as you know, James, the league can be won or lost in the run up to Christmas, the early performance in January
   0.14  0 And I have to say, based on the performance of BA, that leads into Christmas and through the early part of this year
   0.00  1 So it's definitely looking as a very good performance
   0.00  1 But the changes, and I make no apologies, the changes we have made, we've made so that British Airways will be competitive in the long term
  -0.20  0 You have to go through some short-term turmoil to get through that, and we're getting through that
   0.11  0 I think it is -- Stephen if you [ indiscernible ]  We've just completed effectively a 3-year deal with all labor groups, with pilots specifically
   0.00  1 So we're very comfortable in terms of the levels of productivity that we can drive out of the business on an ongoing basis
  -0.25  0 There's talks of pilot shortage
   0.00 -1 I think we've got some issues that are evident in terms of the number of captains that are available, but we don't have an issue
   0.12  0 The market is a bit more competitive really, but there's still plenty of supply in the market side
  -0.20  0 We don't have any concern based on what we're seeing
  -0.20  0 In relation to the share buyback, EUR 500 million last year, we have an intention of EUR 500 million this year
   0.00  1 We believe it's very clearly the right thing to do given where our share price is today
  -0.50  0 Our intentions with regard to excess of cash are very clear
   0.50  0 We will look at inorganic opportunities where we see opportunities
   0.10  0 But great credit to Javier for walking away from that deal because he had a clear view as to the price he was prepared to pay that would generate value for us
   0.25  0 So somebody want us to pay more for that, great
   0.33  0 We understood what the benefit of the inorganic was
  -0.17  0 And if we have excess cash then the board will discuss that and conversations [indiscernible] I've said it before, those conversations are very clear
  -0.25  0 And the second question on the Monarch slot
  -0.17  0 And then   third question, maybe for Lynne, I see she's been sitting here, on the cargo side
  -0.14  1 I guess most of that probably dropped through to the EBIT line given strong global trade flows
  -0.07  0 We're very conscious of where the fuel price is, and so as we've gone into 2018, we're trying to make sure that we can [indiscernible] to not let the fuel price damage [ the division
   0.00  1 ] So, so far, we're seeing the market performing very strong
   0.05  0  And while you're standing, because you used to run Gatwick, and I'll ask Alex to comment as well, but you want to give a view as to how you would see Gatwick developing [indiscernible]?  Indeed, had I still been running Gatwick, I would have been delighted to get hold of the Monarch slot
  -0.17  0 It's very, very difficult to procure or to consider any other options other than short haul
   0.00 -1 And we are kind of thinking what is it that we will do next year, and of course, aircraft availability and such continues to be a big issue
   0.00  1 So the changes have been very well received
   0.00 -1 The short-term issue here is the cost issue, so our cost's increase
   0.00 -1 That's one of the headwinds that we face, and Enrique mentioned
   0.00 -1 And the breakeven in the equation that Willie was mentioning, it's coming, I would say, earlier than we thought
  -0.08  0 A couple of questions, one for Alex, Plan4, just understand where that's at, I think being conservative on EUR 50 million of costs associated with that program over the last 2 years
   0.00  1 LEVEL, I think you've mentioned in the past just the surprise to the upside was how strong ancillary was on a per pack space
   0.00 -1 The industry does recover it in time
  -0.10  1 So that points to support what it is we've been saying that the industry responds much more rationally to these issues, and we expect that to continue to be the case in 2018
  -0.12  0 Not everybody does that in a way that we would describe as maybe rational, but the industry in the main, certainly, that's what we're seeing
   0.00  1 But we're learning from what we're seen
   0.00  1 But what we've seen in LEVEL has reinforced our view that this new business model of low-price seats where the customer gets a choice, we give the flexibility to the customer to decide what it is they want
   0.14  0 And, you make it easy for them when they are aboard the aircraft to buy products that they want to
   0.00  1 But again, very much on track over 200 different initiatives
   0.00  1 Plan4, more than just cost, because cost is just one of the [indiscernible] that's on track
  -0.14  0 But we don't have an intention at this stage or requirement to use any of the Qatar aircraft
  -0.50  0  There will be a limit -- limited amount of leasing this year
   0.33  0 So we had some dialogue to see if there's opportunity there
   0.00  1 And of course, we have done some good developments also in Vueling
   0.12 -1 First, we're just coming down to the BA defined benefit pension changes and as that goes through you've hinted already that's could slow down the progress a little bit of the cost efficiency for the second half of the year
   0.08  0 Does that, therefore, mean that when we're looking at costs from the BA side of IAG for this year, most of that efficiency, if you like, momentum, would likely come from the second quarter onwards [ what's the thinking ]
   0.20  0 If you could expand, give some more details on that, that would be great
  -0.33  0 I think your assertion, Damian, is right
  -0.14  0 And hence, your assertion with regards to is it Q2 onwards, I think that's a fair assumption
   0.00 -1 Next year, probably the figure is going to be lower than that because we are going to have more fleet deliveries
   0.00  1 But having said so, again, the big message is both the regular payments and eventually another, I would say, share buyback program would be well covered, more than 2x by our net [indiscernible]  In terms of the investment, yes, the Iberia performance in 2017 was very good
  -0.20  1 Aer Lingus has been able to grow 12% retaining a 23% ROIC, and we challenged them
   0.00 -1 We need to grow it -- improve our ROIC margin and that's the challenge that we have
   0.00 -1 And second one, Avios has been a little bit absent in the communication for the past couple of months
   0.00  1 In relation to Avios, very good performance, actually it was a record performance for them as well
  -0.50  0 So it's postponed
   0.00 -1 And in fact, it's been a surprise both to [ us centrally ] but also to Vueling
   0.00  1 So I think it just reinforces our view that where we're targeting or we believe are underserved cities in continental Europe from a long haul point of view that you can get into these cities and you can generate new demand, stimulate new demand with the pricing structure that we have
   0.00  1 But going forward, as we exploit the opportunities that we see in Europe, we do see the -- and certainly, that's what we see with others who are trying to do
   0.00  1 Clearly, you've been able to get this airline flying very quickly
   0.00 -1 There's a couple of issues
  -0.17  1 We have a strong presence on the ground there and we know how we can exploit the market there
   0.00  1 When you cross a couple of lines: One, there are more and more 787s in the market, there are more and more 787 qualified pilots in the market, there's more experience and support for 787
  -0.09  0 So as that aircraft matures and as ownership costs decline and as fuel prices maybe change, but, so we're looking at an aircraft decision as much as anything else
  -0.14  0 Just one from my side, in a similar vein to Daniel's question about leaving out talking about Avios
   0.08  0 What are your kind of options and opportunities there?  With the LATAM, as you know, we're pursuing a joint venture that requires regulatory approval
  -0.20  0 So subject to that, we will develop the joint business with LATAM
   0.33  0 We continue to look for opportunities there
   0.00 -1 As you know, we don't have a Chinese carrier in oneworld, which has been an issue for us
   0.17 -1 I'm not concerned that we haven't had a stronger position there in the past
  -0.09  0 We'll probably look at that, but I think I've always dismissed the idea of Air India while government ownership is involved
   0.33  0 But I don't think it would be enough to encourage us to go for this
  -0.17  0 There appears to be an appetite for us, but I'd want to see some evidence of the restructuring
   0.00 -1 Our financial plan hasn't been approved by the board, which was -- I have to be honest, based at a lower fuel price
   0.00 -1 We didn't saw a momentum in the fuel price since we came through the fourth quarter
  -0.12  0 We went back through all of the operating companies to say what do you see in an environment where fuel prices are in the 650 dollar range as opposed to maybe the 550 dollar range
   0.14  0 [ You'd be amazed that ] anybody doesn't do that because given what we're seeing already and the Easter [ effect for one ]
   0.00  1 [indiscernible]  We are growing ahead of the markets
   0.00  1 So we're slightly above what -- growing slightly above and growing unit revenue
   0.00 -1 So I always say when we give headline capacity growth figures of 6.7%, I'd be surprised if it is less than that because we always tweak it on a tactical basis
   0.00  1 We are seeing some interesting growth in the long haul low cost in certain markets
   0.00 -1 I don't expect all of that capacity to materialize given the performance of some of the airlines that we're talking about
   0.00  1 So as we look at the -- but if I look back at 2017, demand exceeded capacity in all markets in 2017, all geographic locations, in all markets
   0.00  1 But in an environment where unit revenue was good, we expect the demand to match the capacity
   0.00  1 It may not exceed the capacity in 2018, but we certainly expect it to match and in some markets, we expect it to exceed
  -0.33  0 So thank you, everyone, for your questions at this time
   0.00  1  Thank you

   0.00  1                                                  Good morning to you all
   0.00  1 So good morning, and thanks for attending our results face-to-face
   0.50  0 It's a real pleasure to see you all
   0.00  1 In my view, these results really demonstrate the quality of our earnings models but also the disciplined approach we take to performance management
   0.00  1 I think the first point is obviously from a revenue standpoint, GBP 2.8 billion, up year-on-year at 7.9% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency
   0.00  1 I think our revenue performance at constant currency was driven by solid organic growth of 2.1%, and it was an acceleration on the organic growth that we saw in '16
   0.00  1 We've delivered a record operating margin of 16.9%, up 90 basis point at actual rate and 110 basis point at constant currency
   0.00  1 We've delivered a full year adjusted EPS of 191.6p, up 14.3% at actual currency and 10.4% at constant rate
   0.00  1 Our cash conversion has remained very strong
   0.00  1 And our free cash flow, as you've seen, was up 7.4%
   0.00  1 We have delivered GDP+ organic growth in 94% of our earnings, with 4.8% organic revenue growth at constant currency in the combined product and Trade divisions
   0.00  1 Our product business grew by 5.5% at constant currency, and our Trade business by 3%
   0.00  1 Important to note is, during the year, we saw the rate of decline in Resources improve from minus 12.3% in H1 to minus 4.5% in H2
   0.00  1 Clearly the highlight of our performance in 2017 is the margin performance
   0.00  1 This is very significant
   0.00  1 We are really proud of these results
   0.00  1   Our business model is highly cash generative
   0.00  1 And our dividend has increased by 36%
   0.00  1 We continue to work in a very disciplined fashion on cash generation
   0.00  1 Our free cash flow, as I said earlier, was up 7.4%
   0.00  1 We believe in the value of accretive, disciplined allocation of capital
   0.00  1 And good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 As André has described, we have delivered a strong earnings growth and cash generation
   0.00 -1 The FX impact on total revenue was 4.9% for the year, driven by the depreciation of sterling, noting that the FX impacts turned slightly negative in the final few months as the pound strengthened
   0.00  1 Net finance costs of GBP 28.9 million were above last year
  -0.22  0 And you'll recall, in 2016, that included FX gains in our non-sterling debtors driven by the devaluation of the pound in the second half
   0.00 -1 Our tax rate was 24.5%, being down 80 bps year-on-year, reflecting a one-off benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities following the recent tax reforms in the U.S
   0.00  1 So overall, fully diluted EPS grew double digits to 191.6p, being up 14.3% at actual rates and 10.4% at constant
   0.00  1 Our free cash flow at GBP 342 million was up strongly in the year, increasing by GBP 24 million
   0.00  1 The overall strong performance in cash flow resulted in a reduction into net debt of -- to GBP 544 million and down by 27% versus last year-end
   0.12  0 And for 2018, effective tax rate is expected to be in the 25.5% to 26% range, with the impact of the recent U.S
   0.00 -1 tax reforms being broadly neutral for the group
   0.08  0 We provide independent quality assurance services that are critically important to our clients, and this is important to sustain the integrity of their supply chains
  -0.17  0 So in a simple expression, what we do for our clients is independent and mission critical
   0.00  1 That's why our return on invested capital is so strong
   0.00  1 We believe that, to drive shareholder value creation on a sustainable basis, you've got to focus on total shareholder value creation
   0.00  1 And the way we define it at Intertek is global GDP+ organic growth plus margin accretion, plus strong cash conversion and, of course, plus disciplined capital allocation in M&A and CapEx
   0.00  1 We expect our product divisions, which represent 75% of our earnings, to grow ahead of global GDP
   0.00  1 Why? Our product growth drivers are truly GDP agnostic
   0.00  1 We expect our Trade divisions, which is about 19% of our earnings, to grow at a rate broadly similar to the GDP through the cycles
   0.00  1 The growth prospects in our resource divisions, which represent 6% of the earnings, are linked, as you know, to the global growth   drivers in the energy sector
   0.00  1 It is obvious that investments in exploration and production for essential resources like oil and minerals will grow in the medium to long term to, of course, meet the demand of the growing population
   0.00  1 We also expect structural growth in the renewable sector
  -0.07  0 The main strategic objectives of our 5x5 strategy is to move the center of gravity of the group towards high-growth and high-margin sectors through to the virtuous economics model that I talked about
   0.00  1 First, we want our employees to be fully engaged and work in a safe environment
   0.00  1 Our second objective is to deliver superior customer service
   0.00  1 Our third target is to deliver margin-accretive organic revenue growth based on GDP+ organic growth
   0.00  1 Fourth, we want to drive a strong cash conversion
   0.00  1 And fifth, we pursue an accretive, disciplined capital allocation policy
   0.04  0 Globally across all of our businesses, we support the existing and emerging needs of our clients in terms of quality assurance in each area of their operations: R&D, raw materials sourcing, component suppliers, manufacturing, transportation, distribution and channel management and consumer management
   0.00  1 Our 5x5 strategy is based on clear goals that are extremely well understood by our employees inside Intertek, and it's very important
   0.06  0 To give you an example, when I visit local markets, I always lead by example and take time to visit customers to talk about our TQA value proposition and get their feedback
   0.11  0 It's important that our leaders really lead from the front and are spending their time in the markets
   0.17  0 Nothing beats the frontline contacts to really understand where the opportunities are
   0.25  0 We take time to recognize achievements of our people
   0.00  1 Recognition is really important to have an engaged organizations
  -0.14  0 And I use these to obviously communicate, connect and ask any questions that our colleagues have
   0.00  1 Our customer-centric entrepreneurial culture is really important, and it is helping us to put customer first
   0.00  1 Our growth and margin-accretive portfolio strategy is moving, as you know, the center of gravity towards higher-growth and higher-margin areas
   0.11  0 And these businesses are Softlines, Hardlines, Electrical & Network Assurance, Cargo/AA and GTS
   0.00  1 The second objective from a portfolio standpoint is to focus on the businesses where we see fast growth and good margin opportunities
   0.08  0 And these businesses are Business Assurance, Agriculture, building and products (sic) [ Building Products ], Transportation Technology and Food
  -0.43  0 And this year, we have basically reviewed quite a number of these business units, which has led to the closure of 8 and the restructuring of 30
  -0.11  1 And we have a systemic approach across business lines, countries and sites; and this is obviously critical to sustain strong margin performance
   0.22  0 We operate a structured performance management calendar that enable us to track progress continuously
   0.00 -1 We never stop looking at ways to strengthen our business
   0.07  0 In our GTS business, for instance, our workflow Astra ERP gives our clients real-time intelligence on how their certificates are progressing through the customer journey
   0.12  0 For instance, one of our latest innovation is InterPret, an algorithm that use big data analytics to predict hydrocarbon composition, providing our clients with real-time information
  -0.17  0 As you would expect, we make investments in our labs with cutting-edge technology
   0.00  1 Very, very important to have this capability
   0.25  0 So I just touched base on a few of these innovations
   0.00  1 We expect robust organic growth momentum in our product businesses   and solid organic growth in our Trade businesses, obviously at constant currency
   0.00 -1 Trading condition in resource will remain challenging in H1, and we expect a gradual improvement in H2
   0.00 -1 And the average sterling rates in the last 3 months, as well as the spot rate, by the way, applied to the full year results for 2017 would provide a reduction of 400 bps at the revenue level and 350 bps at the earnings level
   0.00  1 And we've delivered a margin of 21.6%, up 140 basis points
   0.00  1 Our softline business delivered robust organic growth revenue across all markets
   0.00  1 Moving forward, we expect good organic growth in our softline business driven by increased number of SKUs and brands, supply chain expansion in new markets and increased demand in chemical testing
   0.00  1 Our hardline business report robust organic revenue growth across our main markets of China, Hong Kong, India and Vietnam
   0.00  1 We also see an increased demand for chemical testings and obviously an increased demand for inspection
   0.00  1 And we expect that to continue, driven by the growth for greener and higher-quality commercial buildings in the U.S
  -0.08  0 Obviously, you are seeing the news that we all see where cities are going to ban diesel, which means more R&D investments will go in traditional combustion engine, both hybrid and electrical engines
   0.00  1 We generated good organic revenue growth in our Food business, and we expect that to continue
   0.00  1 As far as chemical and pharma, we saw a solid organic growth
   0.00  1 And we believe that, that will continue
   0.00  1 So for the full year in 2018, we expect our product-related businesses to deliver a robust organic revenue growth
   0.12  0 I'd just like to share some of the innovations we've launched recently in our product business
  -0.17  0 And in our Transportation Technology, you might have seen the press release last -- recently
   0.00  1 Our Trade business delivered organic revenue growth of 3% driven by broad-based revenue growth across business line and geography
   0.00 -1 Our operating margin of 13.7% was slightly down on last year at constant currency
   0.00  1 Our cargo business reports solid organic revenue growth
   0.00  1 Our government and trade service businesses delivered robust organic growth
  -0.40  0 We won quite a lot of new contracts, you will remember from our previous conversations
   0.00  1 Our AgriWorld business delivered robust organic growth
   0.00  1 And we expect to see solid organic growth in 2018, which I'm sure we will talk in the Q&A
  -0.12  0 Agriculture exports can be quite complex from a paperwork standpoint and very time consuming
  -0.11  0 And to ease this process, we've developed a cloud-based export documentation systems that monitors the export process and provides customers with real-time updates on their documentation which can be very cumbersome
   0.00  1 Fuel tank inspections can be costly and risky for our customers, so to make inspection more efficient and certainly safer, we've partnered with a developer of fuel tank inspection, a company that produces robot, to make it obviously easier for our customers
   0.00  1 Operating margin at 5.7% was slightly up year-on-year at constant currency, as we continued to focus on volume, price and obviously cost control
   0.00 -1 The revenue from CapEx Inspection Services was down on last year, driven by a low level of investment in exploration activities from our clients and price pressure
   0.00 -1 In '18, as I said earlier, we expect trading conditions for resource to remain challenging in H1, and we expect a gradual improvement in H2
   0.07  0 Our new PipeAware software allows our pipeline customers to access real-time information on their asset inspections throughout their entire manufacturing process
   0.12  0 Just like to close with a few remarks on what I consider the strengths of Intertek before we take any Q&A
   0.00  1 Intertek has a strong track record of shareholder value creation on sustainable basis
   0.00  1 And moving forward, we believe that our high-quality earnings models will continue to drive sustainable growth for all stakeholders
   0.00  1 We are very disciplined when it comes to margin and cash management
  -0.25  0 So we'll now pause and take any questions you have
   1.00  0 Three, please
   0.08  0 So in terms of end markets, if you look at our portfolio strategy, you've got the priorities where we see, organic, inorganic opportunities for the group
   0.20  0 In addition to that, we will look always at new end markets that attractive
   0.00  1 And depreciation as a percentage of sales in the Products division seems to be lower year-on-year, which has helped the margin seemingly
   0.00  1 And will that continue?  I mean that's a function of, I think, the strong revenue performance we've seen coming through, so yes, I think we could expect that to continue
   0.00 -1 And finally, on the working capital, which is a historic low of 5% of sales
  -0.07  0 And what has been the biggest driving factor behind that?  Well, look, working capital management for us is a critical part of how we think about our business model, our operating model
   0.00 -1 Firstly, I just wondered why margins are going down in the Trade division and if you can you comment on expectations for 2018
   0.14  0 Secondly, the slide in your presentation on the assurance section, very broad maths
   0.00  1 It looks like that's growing around 20%   per year
   0.00 -1 And then just finally, a clarification on the Resources guidance: You say challenging H1, gradual improvement
  -0.17  0 Do you mean growth in H2, or do you mean less of a decline?  Okay, I mean, on -- taking them one by one
    nan -1 with the storms
   0.10  0 So the acquisition we've made in cyber security, in sustainability and obviously also with PSI have some assurance services there
   0.07  0 As far as the competition, I think assurance is an interesting service area because, if you think about it, right, the industry has been known as TIC, testing inspection certifications
   0.09  0 The assurance market is much more underdeveloped from our perspective because that's not where companies have been focused in terms of risk management over the last decade
   0.22  0 And we can take time to talk about some of these, but for me the -- in the assurance business the untapped opportunity is more important, i.e
   0.17  0 They need to complement that with assurance, which is an audit of their operating procedures
   0.00  1 So the growth remain very, very interesting
   0.00 -1 2017, the investment in exploration and productions of our client are still reduced year-on-year
   0.12  0 And I've always said that, until I see 2 or 3 quarters of stable revenue growth in Resources, I don't want to call the bottom
  -0.11  0 And secondly, just a question on inflation in the U.S., particularly on wages, what you're seeing there
  -0.08  0 As far as inflation is concerned, look, it's early days, right, to really take a view on what's going to happen to inflation in the next 12 months
  -0.20  0 The question on operational KPIs is very, very important
  -0.12  0 And as you can imagine, we have 100 countries, 1,000 sites, multiple business lines, so the span of performance is quite wide
   0.07 -1 Having said that, the results we've deliver today wouldn't be possible if we have not seen improvement in many areas in terms of operational metrics
   0.00  1 When you are premium operators, to grow revenue, you've got to do it with a strong pricing power
   0.00  1 I mean NPS has been phenomenal for us
   0.00  1 And they believe in the value of customers
  -0.12  0 And it was part of the Inchcape Group that I know quite well, and the Inchcape family had the same vision
   0.00  1 So where we've launched NPS, which is basically listening to our clients every single month, the reaction has been phenomenal
    nan  1 People love it
   0.00  1 So NPS has been phenomenal in terms of operational metrics
   0.00  1 Turnaround times in our industry is very important
   0.00  1 And every single day can make a huge difference; and the way our teams are focusing on turnaround times is very, very important
   0.00  1 So we have made it clear and very visible to our colleagues that we don't want to be a one-metric company
   0.00  1 We want to make sure we drive consistency, sustainability of results
   0.00  1 So our people believe in the power of data, and therefore our own metrics are very important
  -0.33  0 Sorry, a long answer to a short question
   0.00  1 I get passionate about these things, so..
   0.00  1 We are very disciplined
  -0.18  0 And on the question about Softlines and Agri outlook, you've spotted the differences in terms of objectives, so well done
  -0.25  0 It's in the press, what we've seen
   0.00  1 One is, in the second half of '16 and the first half of '17, we had highly unusually crops in Australia and the U.S., which are 2 important markets for us, and therefore we had significant year-on-year increase
   0.00 -1 And obviously, this year's crop isn't as good as it was
   0.00 -1 And the other thing too is we've seen a bit of demand being brought forward, believe it or not, in our fish operations in Peru and Chile
   0.11  0 So we are a bit more careful on Agri given the strong high-base effect we had in the past and the short-term trends
   0.00  1 As far as the margin improvement is concerned, look, we have done obviously extremely well this year
   0.17 -1 Don't expect that kind of bps improvement every single year
   1.00  0 If you can do 2, 3, even better
   0.00  1 And obviously, what we did is phenomenal
  -0.29  0 The second question, you talked quite a few times about price discipline et cetera
  -0.14  0 I imagine you've done quite a lot of benchmarking of your pricing against peers
   0.17  0 Are you able to give us a flavor for how you see it; and how it's changed over the last 12, 18 months maybe, please?  Yes
  -0.25  0 As you know, there is no -- we'll take the second question, first
  -0.07  0 In a B2B business it's very difficult to know where pricing is, so the only thing I can say is that we are very focused in making sure that, if there are certain bids where our competitors are too aggressive, i.e
   0.00  1 We're going to find a way to make it up, and this is important for us
   0.00  1 And it's still the case, and these guys have done extremely well in 2017
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00 -1 That's down about -- the midpoint of that is down GBP 120 million or so year-on-year in terms of net debt
   0.20  0 And we can [ give the ] kind of construct later on
  -0.12  0  So as far as the other question you have on the impacts of some of the cost initiatives on margin
   0.00  1 Clearly, if you look at -- the level of restructuring we did in '16 was greater than what we did in '17
   0.17  0 Therefore, the sequential effect was what it was in '17, partly due to the other thing that I talk about this morning
  -0.20  0 As far as some of the restructuring that we have done this year -- or last year, you will see it was H1 skewed
   0.00  1 That's why we have this huge breadth and depth of solutions
   0.17  0 And as we obviously see a slightly better organic growth, I think I would personally like to spend slightly more time on innovation
   0.50  0 And innovation, for me, is not only one idea
   0.10  0 It's to basically making sure that everyone inside Intertek understands they have the license to develop innovation
   0.25  0 And internally, I talk about 2 type of innovation
   0.20  0 And the other part of innovation, which is where I spend my time and with our team, is what can we scale from 1 to 100
   0.11  0 Provide our clients with real-time information in terms of predictive analysis and hydrocarbon issues
   0.10  0 So my role in the company is to make sure that innovation, provided it's margin accretive, i.e
   0.00  1 you add value to your clients
   0.17  0 So yes, we want to spend more time on innovation
   0.11  0 The marketing brochure was great, but then when we come to the last 4 months EBITDA or revenue growth, it looks very different
  -0.17  0 And we said, okay, well, maybe it just doesn't justify the price
   0.00  1 The [ strike rate ] is slightly different, which is I will say a good testament of our disciplined approach
   0.00  1 At the end of the day, organic growth in terms of revenue growth has got to be the priority
   0.00  1 Acquisition is here to complement organic revenue growth and to buy a business that adds up to your top line 12 months down the road
  -0.08  0 This is an organic business, and you want to make sure that it contributes to growth and doesn't destroy shareholder value
  -0.22  0 Look, the question you've asked, what if, I think it would be a good problem to have, and we'll deal with it at the right time
   0.00  1 Today, we've given a very strong signal that we believe in the quality of our cash generation
   0.00  1 And we are increasing our dividend payout ratio to 50%, which is a significant commitment to our shareholders
  -1.00  0 2 questions for me, if I can
  -0.20  1 As far as Resources is concerned, I think this is a very, very good point
  -0.12  0 I mean there is no question that given the fact that with the margin that we've delivered, we are almost half from the peak we had at the time when the industry was high
  -0.25  0 The question is when are we going to start seeing the volume increase
   0.00  1 We'll do everything we can to drive revenue performance at a good price
   0.00 -1 The investment have reduced 50% from peak to trough
   0.00  1 The oil and gas companies still are rebuilding their margins, so -- and during these periods, we've seen both volume and price decrease
   0.00  1 You're going to see volume picks up first, and then price
   0.00  1 When you have experienced such a downturn, you have, if you've done a good job, become more productive, more efficient
   0.00  1 I think, over time, we should be able to see some margin uplift, but we'll take it step by step
   0.11  0 But clearly, if you take the numbers at face value over the medium to long term, we are at about 50% of our peak profit, so there is significant scope here
  -0.33  0 The question is how we time it, how we face it
  -0.29  0 Do you have any question, if you are listening in? [Operator Instructions] We don't have any questions coming through yet
  -0.14  0  Okay, okay, it doesn't look like we have question now
   0.00  1 Really appreciate it
  -0.50  0 And obviously, Ed and Josh will be there, if you have any questions
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

   0.00  1 It's very good to be starting here as ITV's Chief Executive

   0.11  0 Quite simply, all platforms need brilliant programs to attract and retain audiences
   0.07  0 We are currently, as I think you all know, undertaking a strategic refresh to help us highlight the opportunities for ITV and also the gaps we will need to address in light of a changing media landscape
  -0.25  0 I will share with you some of the key questions we are asking ourselves as part of that process
  -0.17  0 We will then have time for your questions, although I'm sure you'll understand that we want to finish the refresh before we answer your key strategic questions
  -0.14  0 If you are watching on the webcast incidentally, unfortunately, you won't be able to see this bit
   0.00  1 [Presentation]  So some fantastic content to look forward to there
   0.00  1 But despite the challenges, ITV's operational performance has actually been strong
   0.00  1 Share of viewing was up for the second year running, a first ever for ITV
   0.00  1 There was a significant increase in online viewing up over 30% and with good revenue growth
   0.00  1 And the Studios business delivered significant revenue growth both in total and excluding acquisitions
  -0.08  1 So a solid foundation to build on as the media landscape continues to change and evolve rapidly with more content to watch and more ways to watch it
  -0.12  0 Traditional broadcasters are no longer our only competitors for viewers, for advertising and for quality content
  -0.05  1 The strategy refresh we have kicked off will address all of this, including the need for effective and deep partnerships with advertisers, platforms and content owners to ensure they are the right partnerships for ITV and that we get paid the appropriate value for our content
  -0.06  1 We will come out of it with a clear strategy and well-defined priorities to reestablish and establish where ITV needs to be in 3 to 5 years time and what we need to do to face the challenges and exploit the opportunities ahead
   0.09  0 I've been on the set of the U.K.'s biggest and favorite soaps, Coronation Street and Emmerdale
   0.00  1 It's just incredible to see what goes into producing the high-volume quality content, 6 episodes of each, every single week
   0.00  1 I've also visited some of our production companies, including Mammoth, one of our recent acquisitions, which has a phenomenal slate of dramas, including many which you just saw Victoria, Poldark, Vanity Fair, Shiver, the producers of Paul O'Grady's For The Love of Dogs, you'll be amazed how popular that program is, and Piers Morgan's Life Stories, Twofour who produced This Time Next Year and the Real Marigold Hotel, again, you saw clips of; ITV America who produces scripted reality programs such as Hell's Kitchen, Alone and Fortune & Fire; and Amsterdam-based Talpa, our format business, and of course, producer of The Voice
   0.00  1 It's also been a really good way of getting people involved in the strategy refresh and hearing their feedback and their views
   0.00  1 What has struck me in all of these conversations and meetings is the pride and passion ITV people have for what they do and rightly so
  -0.11  0 And also the critical role ITV plays in the wider media ecology, but also importantly, in society as a whole
   0.00  1 It gives immediate scale, reach and fame for advertisers that just cannot be gained anywhere else
   0.06  0 Recent research by Ubiquity found that for every GBP 1 spent, TV generates over GBP 4 of profit compared to just over GBP 2 for online video and less than GBP 1 for online display
   0.00  1 The ITV Hub delivers a high-quality, trusted and measured environment for advertisers
   0.00  1 It allows us to build direct-to-consumer relationships around our great content and our program brands, something we are just at the beginning of
  -0.11  0   Netflix and Amazon have become important buyers of our content, and it isn't all about drama, which is what you read about all the time
  -0.17  0 They're also looking at unscripted content in the U.S
  -0.12  1 We have strong relationships through our global production and distribution network, and we sell content to over 200 channels globally
  -0.17  0 So I thought I would now share with you some of the key questions we will be asking ourselves as part of the strategy refresh
  -0.12  0 We have 3 big themes in this refresh: content production, advertising and direct-to- consumer
  -0.08  0 For content, we are asking ourselves how we best position ITV Studios to meet the changing demand for content, how we prioritize ITV Studios in the key genres and geographies
  -0.50  0 Those are just a couple of the questions
   0.11  0 For advertising we need to determine how to remain the strongest marketing platform in the U.K
   0.40  0 and what opportunities we can capture and advance advertising solutions
  -0.25  0 We are also exploring questions around data, of course
  -0.25  0 Data strategy is absolutely critical
   0.09  0 Of course, we need to ensure we have the right integrated strategy and operating model so we are also looking at skills and capabilities
   0.00  1 There's a lot to get our teeth into here, but everyone I have met at ITV is really energized about this refresh, and I look forward to sharing that with you when we have those outcomes
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 2017 was always going to be an interesting year and it certainly turned out that way
   0.00  1 Continued economic uncertainty led to the pressure on advertising and earnings, but we've seen strong revenue growth in Studios and online, which led to nonadvertising revenues being up 11%, and external revenues up 2%
  -0.10  1 And that growth, coupled with tight control of costs, has mitigated around half the impact of a 5% decline in advertising
   0.20 -1 However, profits are down 5% to GBP 842 million, which translates to 16p of earnings
   0.00  1 Against this uncertain backdrop, as Carolyn said, the operating performance of the business has been strong
   0.00  1 Operationally, Broadcast had a strong year, growing share of viewing for the second year in a row, delivering a SOCI index over 100%; increasing share of advertising to 47.6% and continuing to grow online and pay both in terms of viewing and revenues
   0.00 -1 However, advertising was down 4.8% or GBP 81 million, and that's hard to mitigate
   0.33 -1 However, profits fell to just under GBP 600 million with margins down 1% to 29%
   0.00  1 Within broadcast, online had a strong year with revenues up 15% and online viewing was up nearly 40%, whether measured by requests or time spent on the hub
   0.00  1 Share of viewing across the family was up 0.4 percentage points to 21.7%, with growth on the main channel and ITV2 and 4
   0.00  1 If we do that, we'll keep our compelling advertising proposition
   0.11  0 We delivered 99% of commercial audiences over 5 million, which is around 780 shows, roughly the same numbers as last year but without the benefit of a big sports tournament
   0.00  1 This shows the importance of the soaps being strong and continued investment in quality drama and entertainment
   0.00  1 ITV2 and ITV4 performed well in delivering their target demographic, viewing from 16-34s on ITV2 was up 17% driven by Love Island and the Seth MacFarlane shows; and movies and sports delivered a 12% increase in male audiences on ITV4
  -0.33  0 They love our content and want to watch it whenever and wherever
   0.00  1 And the Hub delivers real incremental profit as the cost of the content are largely paid for through linear broadcast
   0.00  1 BritBox is ahead of plan and has already got over 250,000 subscribers
   0.00  1 Tech and telco spend was strong on the back of new product launches, car revenues were positive all year, again driven by new models, and the supermarkets also spent more, though weakness in the high street meant the retail category as a whole was down 3%
   0.00  1 Across Q4, we saw supermarkets, FMCG, finance cars, entertainment and telco advertising all up year-on-year
  -0.05  1 We've maintained our investment in original content through the advertising cycle and with a healthy mix of drama, entertainment and the soaps and daytime, this quality content continues to underpin the strength of our advertising proposition
   0.00  1 Moving to Studios which had a strong year delivering nearly GBP 1.6 billion of revenue, 13% growth, 7% on an organic basis
   0.00  1 There's been growth across all areas of the business
   0.00  1 growing by 28%, excluding currency with the return of Hell's Kitchen, Good Witch and our drama pilot Snowpiercer; the international business, especially France and Australia, had a strong year, driven by the production of U.K
  -0.11  1 and Talpa formats; and the growth in GE came from drama, offsetting our decline in DVD sales
   0.20  0 Overall, profits were, as we expected, flat year-on-year
   0.00  1 This is a one-off, so being flat year-on-year is a good result and shows a continuing growth from the underlying business
   0.00 -1 We've talked before about the lumpiness of our Studios business and how shows move around
   0.00 -1 This means there's always churn
  -0.25  0 And last year to standstill, we had to replace over GBP 300 million of revenue
   0.00  1 On this basis, Studios has delivered 5% compound annual revenue growth from the core business, that's the business we had before 2012, excluding all acquisitions and currency
   0.00  1 Similarly, it's important we produce a decent return on the capital we invest
   0.00  1 On either basis, this return is well ahead of our cost of capital
  -0.17  0 And as this slide shows, we produced over 300 hours of scripted content last year
   0.00  1 is growing nicely with series such as Victoria, Unforgotten and Cold Feet; and we're gaining momentum in the U.S
  -0.17  0 In 2017, we invested around GBP 240 million in producing scripted content, so around GBP 80 million more than last year
   0.00  1 And this growth in returning series reflects the quality of the pipeline
   0.00  1 We've over 3,000 hours of entertainment being made globally, including The Voice and the Celebrity Hell's Kitchen and The Chase, and the number of hours produced is growing by over 80% in the last couple of years
  -0.12  0 We've chosen to invest in rights and content with the potential to return in travel
   0.00 -1 Pulling all of the above together, the NAR decline had the biggest impact on profit, down GBP 81 million
  -0.08  1 Lower schedule costs and GBP 29 million of overhead savings in part offset this; while in Studios, the good growth from the underlying business is held back by the difficult comps
   0.06 -1 We did continue to invest in the business on the Hub, our box office trial and new creative in Studios, especially in the U.S., and the net of all this is our EBITA of GBP 842 million, down GBP 43 million or 5%
   0.12 -1 And after interest which came in at GBP 33 million and tax, an effective rate of 19%, EPS was 16p, down 6%
   0.00 -1 On a statutory basis, EPS is down 9% or 10.2p
  -0.08  1 Moving on, the balance sheet remains robust supporting our investment-grade credit, and we continue to have good access to liquidity
   0.00  1 Operating cash flow is over 90%, which is a real positive, not least when we invested so much in scripted projects, which had around a GBP 55 million negative impact on our working capital
  -0.25  0 The net pension deficit is GBP 83 million
   0.00 -1 This is GBP 245 million lower than last year due to GBP 80 million of company contributions, good asset returns and updated member experience data
   0.14  0 This will be driven by sports, having 10 England games as part of the new schedule of matches, plus with the rugby World Cup; and we also plan to invest more in drama, ideally drama we create, own and control the rights to, benefiting from being an integrated producer broadcaster
   0.00  1 This will impact Broadcast in 2019 but deliver future returns to Studios
   0.25  0 These will impact profit by around GBP 15 million to GBP 20 million
   0.00  1 Half of this relates to cost of occupying new London properties, plus there's initial investments in addressable advertising, our self-serve advertising trial and improved functionality for the hub such as series so far and box sets, which we'll get back following the closure of the Encore channel on Sky later this year
  -0.08  0 The Encore closure will impact our pay revenues by around GBP 20 million, though this will be offset by the continued double-digit growth in online advertising
  -0.17  0 Tax rate is expected to be 19% and this has been reassessed in light of the U.S
  -0.12  0 As far as CapEx is concerned, there's GBP 60 million of business-as-usual CapEx and in addition, there will be around GBP 40 million of investment in our London property project, including fit out of new offices and design and initial demolition costs, all subject to the final planning approvals
   0.07  0 This project will run for several years probably to 2023 and we'll update as the project progresses and we decide on exactly how we'll procure the various space of the building
  -0.10  1 So in summary, there's no doubt 2017 was a tough year for advertising, but all of the parts of the business have performed well both financially and operationally
   0.00  1 And we have a really strong foundation as we plan for the future
   0.00  1 Viewing has been really strong with the schedule including the return of Dancing on Ice, The Voice, Vera, Endeavour, Trauma, Six Nations; record viewing for our key daytime shows and the sixth episode of Coronation Street
   0.00  1 Our Family share of viewing so far is up 7% and total viewing volumes are actually up too up 3% and online viewing is up 22%
   0.00 -1 The economic outlook remains uncertain
   0.00  1 We have already sold the sponsorship to 3 brands and we are currently selling advertising slots, demand for which is really strong
   0.20  0 It's a great example of ITV operating as an integrated producer broadcaster, but also in a very 360 way, and more of that when we do the strategy   refresh
   0.00  1 And of course, we remain extremely focused on the business
   0.00  1 We have a solid foundation to build on, as you have seen, with a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows
   0.00  1 This gives ITV the flexibility to make the right strategic choices for the long-term in a competitive environment, while we still deliver sustainable returns to shareholders
   0.00  1 And thank you for your time this morning, and we are now very happy to take your questions
   0.00 -1 There's a perception within the TV production industry that perhaps they relatively struggled
  -0.08  0 Can you sustain that for a third year?  Okay, on what you described on retran, I mean, we believe and continue to believe that we have to be paid fairly for our content
  -0.17  0 And those then become partnerships and commercial agreements which are quite broad in their nature
  -0.08  0 ITV America, New York mainly and L.A, but mainly New York, is a production business that is just producing high-volume unscripted content for multiple channels in America
   0.10  0 is, and again, I only spent 1.5 hours with the person leading that, but it's a very -- a totally different business with a totally different model
   0.00  1 And actually, ITV has done that in a very stealthy kind of low risk way, actually
  -0.08  0 And of course, we are looking in the strategy refresh as to what we said to you about geography and about genre and both of the things are -- those things are very important, I think questions to address when it comes to scripted in America
  -0.08  0 We've got a much broader mix of customers, in particular, some of the SVOD and FANG group of companies who are looking for different types of content
  -0.05  0 One of the things on the slide, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, is a reboot of the old format being sold to one of those companies, and we find that quite interesting because they're now looking -- we talked before about the demand for drama, demand for drama from Netflix and Amazon
   0.00  1 They're looking for all types of different genre and we're well-placed to serve that
  -0.06  1 You've seen the accounts, there's no write-offs in the accounts, there's no concerns about the quality of the business in the accounts, and our Studios business has delivered 7% growth organically, 13% in total
  -0.08  1  On viewing, I won't ask Kevin to answer that question because he will always take kind of -- he'll say, "but I think our...", but I think actually, we've done really, really well, and I think that's really about the quality of our content and also about developing this kind of -- the way we deal with consumers
   0.00  1 And I think our aim, obviously, is to sustain that
  -1.00  0 Again, 3 questions
   0.00  1 I mean if you look at this business, net debt EBITDA is 1x, you are very cash flow generative, and obviously, you said over the strategic refresh that's why you're holding things back
  -0.14  0 Yet, sort of -- I mean, that sounds as though there is the potential sort of for quite significant outlays
   0.00 -1 Your NAR was down 5 but if we include sponsorship and VOD growth, you're actually down 3 for '18
   0.00  1 And sort of in terms of that delta between the 2, '18 you've got extra sponsorship revenues presumably from the World Cup, you've got continuous strong growth in VOD
   0.00  1 It is very -- that's a very important kind of thing for us
   0.00  1 But that also means we have to have a healthy and fit business for the next 5 years
   0.00 -1 We have to be competitive
  -0.10  0 And that's what we're assessing at the moment, which is how can we be competitive over the next 5 years for content, for advertising and retaining viewers in all our platforms and how do we monetize them, which I think comes really down to your question about VOD, revenue and how we drive that with the user experience, kind of interrelated with that because we've just got to make sure that we don't do something too quickly that has unintended consequences on something else
   0.04  0 And I'll bring Ian in at the moment but it is interesting your point about NAR and non-NAR because of course we don't -- I mean, of course, we care about any shifts, but effectively, it's -- what we really care about is the total pot and that we're getting the revenue from our advertisers and also we're getting it from other means
   0.11  0 But the capital policy needs to enable us to execute the strategy and those things all need to be aligned as does the reporting
  -0.12  0  Just a quick follow-up question, I mean you mentioned in terms of advertisers -- some advertisers coming back in, in the second half
  -0.05  0 So is that sort of just initial steps or are you starting to see now an acceleration of advertisers saying hold on a minute in terms of online advertising there are doubts let's shift it back into TV?  I think it's a combination of things
  -0.17  0 So I don't think it's a very clear cut binary thing
   0.20 -1 There is a big, big issue around transparency and measurability
   0.00  1 So we have a very, very trusted environment and a very measurable environment
  -0.20  0 That is definitely permeating advertisers, there's no question about that
   0.15  0 You want to plan media to be effective, and if it's not effective, then it doesn't matter what   you're doing to be seen to be keeping up with the trend
  -0.06  0 But actually where they're cutting costs from is agency fees and production budgets rather than on media spend because I think people know that you have to spend money to advertise when you're having a tough time
  -0.50  0 There's a question up there
  -0.14  0 I understand you -- first question, I understand you don't want to prejudge the refresh
  -0.06  0 And then thirdly, on Studios outlook, are we on course for a rev organic growth consistent with that 5% that we saw -- that we've seen over the past 5 years?  Okay, those are very big questions, the first 2
   0.00 -1 But I think that I don't actually think there has been that much of a dislocation
   0.00 -1 I don't think the economic environment is that strong
   0.00 -1 Actually, that's not our -- that's not what we've seen
   0.00 -1 We've seen actually quite a big economic effect on our advertising spend because of economic uncertainty and consumer lack of confidence, actually
  -0.06  1 I mean, I'll bring Ian in here because I think actually what's quite amazing about ITV is what an amazing -- it's a really unique model because if you think about it, we are the only free-to-air advertiser that has no safety net
  -0.14  0 So we are the only free-to-air model, and I think that gives us quite a lot to think about
  -0.07  1  The only thing I'd add to that is when you look at what's happening in the world around us, owning more of your own content being in control of more of your own content definitely feels like a strategic advantage
   0.00  1 When you look at what everybody else is doing around us, that seems to be a really good place to be starting from
   0.00  1 On the Studios outlook, we fully expect Studios to have another good year of revenue growth
  -0.04  1 And that causes quite a lot of fluctuation in terms of things moving around in terms of 1 year to the next, but the fundamentals of the Studios business, as hopefully you heard today, right across the board both in the U.K., the U.S., the rest of the world are in really good shape and the pipeline of new shows coming through is good
  -0.50  0  Lots of questions
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
   0.05  0 And then last one, just quickly on IFRS 15, can you just remind us is there any effect on that particularly in the Studios business, I guess?  On the program spend, I mean, I think that you've seen for 2019 it's been driven really by sports and also by drama
   0.25  0 We know about that now, you have to get sports rights, you get years in advance, not just kind of months in advance
   0.00  1 So I think that's a good thing for you to see as the program spend for that year because that's what we've said
  -0.25  0 Do you want to take the drama and the revenue breakdown?  It's a good question, Steve, about breaking down the GBP 1.6 billion or so of Studios revenue by genre
  -0.50  0 And then what was the other question?  IFRS
   0.10  0 In fact, there's no impact on the Studios business looking back historically and the opening position
   0.17  0 It's immaterial, it's less than GBP 10 million and has no profit impact
  -0.14  0 I do like everybody else, not prejudging the refresh but asking questions about the refresh
   0.00 -1 So it looks like you've not been aggressive on marketing
  -0.67  0 The second question is on content
  -0.50  0 That's my second question
  -0.12  0 Do you feel that it's something you should change?  Do you want to do BritBox first?  Carolyn's going to smile when I answer this question
  -0.04  1  Which we have a -- actually, Julien, it's a really good point, and Carolyn will smile when I say this, because I went over and met the BritBox team shortly after launch, and they were actually quite proud that they were performing ahead of plan in terms of subscribers and hadn't spent much on marketing
  -0.17  0  Yes, so on content, and obviously, Ian can come in here as well and maybe Kevin and Julia
  -0.06  0 I mean, I don't -- I think it's very interesting to talk about subscale because actually, I think it's really about the quality of your content and how many viewers you attract or how much money you get for the value of your content
   0.00  1 So I think we're doing well on both of those things
  -0.14  1 So I think Snowpiercer is a good example of that, World On Fire is a good example of that
   0.00 -1 So I don't feel -- I don't think we feel that we're subscale in any way
  -0.11  1 I think we feel that our content is incredibly strong, and that we have to continue to be very strong because content is the thing that drives our viewers, and therefore, that drives everything that we do
  -0.33  0  Last question on advertising
  -0.17  0 I think it is -- your question is largely about CRR, I think isn't it
   0.08  0 I think actually the less I'll say about that in this forum the better because I think we have got CRR, and I think it can obviously be restrictive
   0.00  1 I mean for those -- I don't know how many people are familiar with CRR, but I mean, the fact is you can reduce spend and still get your share and therefore -- and you get no penalty as a result of that whereas most media, the more volume you put in, you'll get a price advantage
  -1.00  0  Patrick Wellington from Morgan Stanley, 3 questions
  -0.20  0 Ian, can break down the 2019 extra GBP 50 million between the accidental football element and the drama element, which might be a bit more studied
  -0.12  0 And it's linked directly, slightly to Steve's point about breaking out drama hours
   0.00  1 It is doing well, it is diversifying us
   0.00 -1 Because things have changed rather a lot in the last year
   0.00 -1 We're now in a different world and we are going to have to compete harder for viewers and advertisers
  -1.00  0 Just 3 questions
  -0.17  0 First one, just a follow-up on Patrick's on the changing content spend
   0.00 -1 How do we think about that in '18 given that you've obviously got investments coming in and you've obviously got some FX headwinds and obviously you've got probably more shows that are coming through that make you lower margin initially
  -0.11  0 And then the last question, just want to understand in terms of the statement about committed to the ordinary dividend policy
   0.00  1 Because at the heart of that is giving ourselves the best chance for creating the next Broadchurch or the best Downton, a breakout hit
   0.00  1 The internal labels that we have before are in really good shape as well
   0.04  0 And as Carolyn said, acting more as an integrated producer broadcaster and that GBP 25 million is a rough net impact on the program spend in terms of shows going in, in terms of drama and the other shows have to come out, because clearly, we've got a full schedule
   0.20  0 And in terms of Studio's profitability, I agree with you, Richard
   0.33  0 That's when you make your profit
   0.00  1 And as we've said, our credit rating is important to us, running a tight balance sheet is important to us, having a balance sheet that supports strategy is very, very important as well
  -0.25  0 Just 1 question on the Studios business
   0.00 -1 I guess, if you give Studios free reign and it starts to commission more content for BBC, Channel 4 and that's successful, it potentially compromises your own   channel advertising
  -0.10  0 So does that have free reign or is there some kind of constraint you put around the kind of content they produce for other broadcasters?  They have free reign actually
  -0.25  0 They are a commercial business and they have to make money out of content
   0.00  1 It's up to Kevin to ensure that we get the best commissions
  -0.04  0 Is that more as a percentage of a declining pot or you're actually seeing it in absolute terms going up in the fourth quarter and possibly give an indication for the first quarter? Secondly, on ownership of Sky, Comcast's presentation centered on the strategic rationale revolving around scale benefits, distribution and content
  -0.25  0 Your peers have been arguing that they're going to be beneficiaries from scale
  -0.07  0 And then thirdly, just on the restructuring chart -- sorry, on the exceptional charge guidance for 2018, of the GBP 85 million, Ian, how much is not related to acquisition accounting?  I'll deal with that one first because that's the easiest
   0.00  1 On the FMCG side, we did see a return to growth from FMCG across Q4
   0.00  1 Food is good, cosmetics is good, household is down
  -0.14  0 Would you want to say what you think?  Yes, Sky's content is interesting because they have to bid for it every 3 years, if you think of what really differentiates Sky content
   0.00  1 I think that's an interesting place to be
  -0.17  0 And they've clearly got the content that's on Sky Atlantic, which a change of ownership of that might lead to question marks about who gets that content as well
  -0.17  0 Who knows?  That's why I didn't answer the question
  -0.33  0  There's a question right at the back
   0.00 -1 Can you just give us some initial impressions, Carolyn, about where you think it needs to get to in terms of pay per view capabilities or is there anecdotal evidence that you had some problems around the Groves/Eubank fight in signing up customers
  -0.07  0 Digital ad insertion, whether you think you can -- where you are in the journey, whether you think you can get there organically or you need some sort of external investment to fix that potential problem
   0.12  0 How comfortable are you in ITV's position, medium, long-term as still largely a U.K
   0.00  1 That's good for users, but it's good for ITV
  -0.06  0 I mean, they might complain to Ofcom about something on screen, but it's much -- it takes a bit of time and then it's -- whereas with this it's much more visceral and immediate and you've got to have a way of responding to that quickly and the infrastructure to do that
   0.00  1 It's interesting and it's definitely another revenue stream
   0.00  1 So just putting it in perspective, it was a good thing for us to do and it was a good experience for us to do
   0.08  0    Well, I think the regulatory position probably gets a bit clearer and cleaner with Disney stroke Comcast versus FOX
   0.00 -1 But we'll leave that to the experts to determine because it was clearly a challenge around FOX and I can't say plurality which is the word of the moment, but it's probably a bit easier with Comcast and Disney
  -0.12  1  Yes, and as to the global media groups, I mean, I think that we are very, very strong in our home market and we are a global media player on the content side, and I think recognized to be global on content
   0.00 -1 is a formidable thing to be
   0.00  1 ITV actually, one of the things we are really, really focused on is being agile and nimble and being able to move quite quickly over the next 5 years on things that we need to do and really focusing on the things that we do better than anybody else
   0.00  1 And there are quite a lot of things we do better than anybody else
   0.08  0 Can you just talk us through what's the disconnect between some of those numbers?  I don't think there's been a fundamental change in the broader level of confidence across U.K
  -0.18  0 So I think corporates are behaving quite cautiously, quite carefully, spending money with a fair degree of rigor and balance across the board
   0.00 -1 But as a whole, I think we're still operating in an environment with the overhang of uncertainty in it
   0.00  1 We've expect the first half of the year to be strong
   0.00 -1 We shouldn't get too hung up on whether April is down or March is up
   0.17  0 It's what does the year feel like, what does confidence feel like
   0.00 -1 And the fact we're up across the first 6 months after Q4 being up in 2018 suggests to me at least things have calmed down
   0.00  1  I think that's a really good way of putting it
   0.10  0 But it hasn't solved any issues yet because we still don't know whether that transition agreement is going to be signed and also whether what that's going to contain
   0.00 -1 So there is still uncertainty, which is -- but it is definitely a calmer corporate environment
  -0.10  0 No doubt we'll be looking at, as Carolyn mentioned in her view at the start, what's the right operating model for us
  -0.09  0  Can you just quickly confirm Ian, just on The Voice and the treatment of that as an exception on the failure to actually pay that, when do you actually expect to receive all or what's the actual cash schedule for receiving that?  Well, there isn't a cash schedule set out and we are pursuing very vigorously by Talent who are our partner in China, and we've got an insurance claim with the credit insurers who underwrote the original content

   0.00  1                                                          So good morning, everybody
   0.00  1 In particular, you'll note that with underlying earnings per share, up by 8% in the second half year compared to the comparative period the previous year, we are growing earnings again for the first time for several years
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 Cost savings and Argos synergies were both ahead of plan
   0.00  1 The final dividend is up 8%, reflecting earnings growth in the second half
   0.00  1 In the year, sales were up 9%, largely reflecting the full year's consolidation of Argos versus only part year in the previous year
   0.00 -1 EPS was down, reflecting a full year's dilution of the shares issued in relation to the HRG acquisition
   0.08  0 Non-underlying cost related to 3 main areas: the new bank program, the Argos integration and the recently announced reorganization of our management teams in store
   0.00  1 In the year, we saw sales growth across all channels
   0.00  1 We grew like-for-likes 1.3%
   0.00  1 And taking out the impact of the consolidating the Argos and the Habitat businesses, sales grew 1.6% with strong performance from the grocery business with growth of 2.3%
   0.00  1 In General Merchandise, we outperformed a very tough market, gaining share despite some drag from the closure of Argos stores inside Homebase stores
   0.00  1 And clothing grew just under 4% across the year
   0.00  1 Our grocery business had a good year
   0.00  1 In a challenging general merchandise and clothing market, we're pleased with our performance
   0.00  1 As I said, we grew Clothing sales by 4%
   0.00  1 We grew share in General Merchandise, with particularly strong performances in areas like audio, mobiles and videogames
   0.00  1 We have a proven track record in delivering synergies from the HRG acquisition
  -0.25  1 The bank delivered a good performance this year in a challenging market
   0.00  1 Net interest margin has increased to 4.9% with the inclusion of Argos Financial Services
   0.00 -1 However, excluding Argos Financial Services, the net impact -- the net interest margin has been impacted by continued pressure in the unsecured market
   0.00 -1 In the year just started, we expect bank profits to decline
   0.00 -1 There are 4 factors at play here: firstly, tighter profit margins on new lending and reduced lending; and secondly, a predicted modest increase in bad debt provision in the current climate
   0.17  0 That will take us from GBP 69 million to GBP 48 million, effectively like- for-like
  -0.06  0 And finally, there's a cost of the new IFRS 9 accounting standard, which basically has a more conservative view of how you provision for bad debts, and this is something that clearly will be applied right across the banking sector
   0.00  1 In the year, we delivered strong free cash flow of GBP 432 million, up year-on-year strongly, which allowed us, as I said, to reduce our net debt to under GBP 1.4 billion
  -0.14  0 Our combined pension deficit reduced from GBP 850 million to GBP 261 million at the year-end
   0.07  0   As you know, our aim is to reduce debt over time, and we're targeting adjusted net debt to EBITDAR ratio of less than 3x and fixed charge cover of greater than 3x
   0.00  1 Against this background, we plan to deliver further GBP 200 million of cost savings and GBP 60 million of EBIT from synergies
   0.11 -1 As noted earlier, we expect the profit of the bank to reduce, and we're comfortable with the 2018 consensus of GBP 629 million
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 He has been instrumental in getting this transaction together from the Walmart side
   0.00  1 And I'd like to thank Judith and Roger for their help and support also over the next -- over the last period of time in their pragmatic approach to getting this deal to where it is today
   0.00  1 The Walmart board, Doug McMillon, and the Sainsbury's board chaired by David have enabled this transaction to occur through a very pragmatic approach of breaking through the various hurdles that we have to in a situation like this
   0.00  1 So I thank those boards for their help and support
   0.00  1 The other point I would emphasize is that a lot of the people that I've talked about know each other extremely well
   0.00  1 But we can use the synergies that will be generated by this deal to sharpen both the customer propositions
   0.07 -1 And you could also   see on that slide some of the downsides of not reacting to those market conditions because clearly, if you don't adapt and you don't adapt fast enough, that ultimately that will lead to businesses going out of business
   0.00  1 And that's an important factor as well
   0.00  1 And indeed, by bringing the businesses together, we create more security for both sets of pension holders
   0.00  1 And last but by no means least, for shareholders, we create value
   0.00  1 The combined business will have very strong cash generation, and we'll have investment-grade profile
   0.20  0 And as you can see from this slide, Asda already has the #2 position by volume for the George clothing brand
   0.00  1 Sainsbury's has grown the Tu clothing brand over the last number of years, and again, is #6 by volume in the U.K
   0.00  1 The businesses have highly complementary store portfolios, and I think this chart illustrates it really, really well
   0.00  1 Sainsbury's is strong in the southeast of England and Northern Ireland
   0.00  1 Asda is strong in the Midlands, north of England, Scotland and Wales
   0.00  1 So a very complementary store portfolio
   0.00  1 Roger?  Good morning, everybody
    nan  1 Good to see you all
   0.50  0 Great to be here this morning
  -0.25  0 I know quite a few of you, but for those I don't, I'm Roger
   0.00  1 It's fair to say therefore across that, I think I'm a reasonably good judge of the fit of this combination
  -0.33  0 We are, for the avoidance of doubt, multiformat already
   0.00  1 We have a grocery online business, which is going gangbusters, grew in low -- in high single digits last year
   0.00  1 We have a George.com business, which is growing really well at over 30% year-on-year growth last year
   0.00  1 So we're pretty omnichannel already and that's certainly growing
   0.00  1 We have an undisputed EDLP heritage
   0.00  1 Low prices is in our DNA, and that's something we're really getting back to, and that's part of our momentum that I'll touch on in a second
   0.00  1 And our George Home business is growing really well, 12% year-on-year market share growth last year in our George Home, so strong heritage in the general merchandise and clothing
   0.00  1 So first of all, we are delivering growth
   0.00  1 We have momentum back
   0.00  1 Cash flow generation is strong, GBP 4 billion between 2014 and '16, and that's carried on through last year as well
   0.00  1 And last but not the least, with strong asset backing, very low net debt and 75% freehold, our estate
   0.00  1 And as I said, we have momentum in the business
   0.00  1 So we've got consistent like-for-like sales growth
   0.00  1 We're further developing our digital and online capability, as I said, driving more growth and sophistication in our home shopping offers
   0.00  1 We'll have scan and go in 200 stores by the end of the year, which customers really tell us they love and keeps them in control of their shops
   0.00  1 So lots more development online and digital capability paying dividends
   0.00  1   So we have momentum
  -0.17  1 We're doing all the right things, and our strategy continues to invest in all those things, but no danger
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 They've got very clear propositions
   0.17  0 As Roger has already said, there are opportunities to look at sourcing, and IPL is an example of that
   0.00  1 And last but no means least, both businesses are making very substantial investments in helping customers shop more flexibly
   0.00  1 If you look at grocery, both businesses have strong online grocery businesses and have an increase in in- store technology
   0.00  1 And we mustn't forget the combined strength of the group as far as general merchandise and clothing is concerned
   0.00  1 We also have a strong and fast-growing online clothing business in both businesses, so whether that's George online or as already been alluded to by Kevin, the launch of Tu online with Argos
   0.00  1 And the business will be run by the best leaders from both businesses
   0.00 -1 economy and a major taxpayer, as I've already said
   0.00  1 More streamlined supply chain means more efficiency as far as supplies are concerned
   0.00  1 Both businesses again have a heritage of bringing   new and differentiated products to market
   0.00  1 And it will protect choice for customers -- or we will protect choice for customers in the future
   0.00  1 If I talk a little bit about the buying synergies or the net synergies, the first point I would make is that the gross synergies are substantially higher than the net synergies we are talking about on this slide
   0.00  1 The net synergies, the GBP 500 million, is what we will deliver to the bottom line of the combined entity at the end of the second complete year of the combination
   0.14  0 It does not take into account any further volume benefits that might be accreted from the combination of the 2 buying books
   0.08  0 We understand that model, and we understand the benefits that will come from reducing rent rates and overall overheads within the Argos portfolio by making those moves
  -0.25  0 But I go back and just stress that this GBP 500 million is a net synergy number
   0.00  1 There is a gross synergy number, which is higher than that, and that's what gives us the capacity to invest back into the underlying proposition
  -0.10  0 So we'd expect those GBP 500 million of EBITDA synergies to drop to the bottom line of the combined entity by the end of the second year
   0.00  1 If you combine all those numbers, the combined entity compared with Sainsbury's EPS, we'll have double- digit EPS accretion, low double-digit ROIC and a substantially reduced level of leverage
   0.00  1 And that will create value for shareholders
   0.20  0 So just to give a bit of color to the strengthened balance sheet
   0.00  1 And the combined group will be very, very cash generative
   0.00  1 A more dynamic, more adaptable, more resilient business for the future
  -0.12  0 And we shouldn't underestimate the fact that this will be a British PLC and a massive contributor to the British economy
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1  Good morning, everybody
   0.50  0 So no, it's great to be here
   0.00  1 business
   0.00  1 One is Rakuten in Japan, and the other one is JD.com in China, both of which have really helped us build capabilities in our business that we didn't have previously
   0.00  1 business, a PLC of a combined business that will be able to lower the cost of living for the U.K
   0.00  1 And we're able to do that and what got us thinking is that these new ways of operating where we shouldn't be wanting to do everything ourselves
   0.00  1 That's very unique in the way that we've been thinking
   0.00  1 It's unique to this market as well and speaks very much to how we see the 2 businesses coming together
   0.00  1 And one of the things about that is it allows us not only to unlock value, and we've talked about this for customers, for shareholders, for colleagues -- I have to remember to say colleagues back in the U.K
   0.00  1 So we can do that, but not only we can do that, but Walmart can actually maintain an active share in the U.K
  -0.11  0 Well, many of you will have heard us talking about the fact that we have been very deliberate and thoughtful in our review of the international portfolio perhaps in a way that we haven't done before
   0.00  1 What you know is that we're   transforming the business
   0.00  1 And what's really important to us is creating strong, agile, local businesses, locally relevant for customers right around the world
   0.00  1 And I think you've heard both Roger and Mike talk about how that is a really strong fit for us as a business
   0.00 -1 The second area, which is true to the DNA of Walmart, is low prices
   0.00  1 Omnichannel, seamless and convenient
   0.00  1 So this, for us, creates a really dynamic new player in the market
   0.00  1 It's important to create a strong U.K
   0.00  1 That's what makes this completely unique
   0.00  1 And one of the things that we bring to the party is our global expertise
   0.17  0 General merchandise sourcing is probably our strongest element of that
   0.00  1 And you can imagine an unlock for the joint business going forward
   0.12  0 But the other thing that when you think about those markets that we operate in and you think about a market like China, which is probably one of the most advanced ecosystems and e-commerce markets in the world, we operate there and we operate there effectively
   0.00  1 That Alibaba competing with those kind of people is something that we've really, really got some experience on, and we hope to be able to bring to bear not just for this market and for Roger and the team and the combined business but right around all of the businesses that we operate in
   0.00  1 It's good for both of the businesses, and it means we can deliver long-term value into our shareholders as Walmart as well
   0.00  1 So with that, I'm just going to end with where Mike started, which is a huge thank you, a massive thank you to both of the teams who've worked so hard on this in the last couple of weeks, but particularly, as you can imagine, we pulled this forward a little bit in the last couple of days to get this done
  -1.00  0 Two questions for me
  -0.33  0 retailers you took, that would take about 20% of disposal, which should make it uneconomic
  -0.06  0 But just going back to the Horsegate scandal a few years ago, you made it quite clear that the values and culture of Sainsbury's were very much focused on integrity of sourcing, knowing where your food came from and things like that
   0.00  1 So what has changed in your view in the difference of culture since those days that you suddenly think it's a good cultural fit for the 2 companies?  Thank you
  -0.38  0 I don't recall ever using any reference to a number of disposals and certainly not a 20% reference to a number of disposals
  -0.22  0 And clearly, the CMA is a critical part -- the CMA process is a critical part of this transaction
  -0.12  0 And it's very different to the last time this market was investigated, which was 2007, or the last time a major transaction took place, which was in 2004
   0.00  1 We think ultimately, this transaction will act to the customer good
  -0.12  0 We've also been absolutely clear, and it's probably the biggest question I've been asked over and over again on the media this morning, is there will be no store closures as a result of this transaction
  -0.25  0 And indeed, the CMA, I think, would set out that as an objective as well
  -0.14  0 As far as shared cultures are concerned, yes, we all have our ups and downs in terms of day-to-day running of our businesses
  -0.50  0 No store closures
  -0.11  0 So there's a scope for disposals which would be planned for?  Yes, we've made some underlying assumptions
  -0.14  0 The first question, you talked about obviously the ambition to lower your prices on some everyday lines by 10%
   0.10 -1 You've already reaffirmed full year FY '19 guidance despite the, let's call it, a profit warning in the bank
  -0.08  0 And then the second question related to the Bank, I think Asda financial services, which only operates as a broker made about GBP 35 million in the last subsidiary accounts that were filed
  -0.10  0   As far as the Asda financial services is concerned, Asda made a decision several years ago to not being within the banking business
  -0.17  0 And interestingly, we've since disposed of some of our banking businesses in areas like Mexico and some of those
   0.00  1 And I think it's one of the things that the combined business will be able to look at in the long term and see what the right answer is
  -0.14  0 So there's a long list, and I'm sure we get lots of questions
   0.06  0 There's probably 20 or 30 items we haven't addressed directly because of the need to get to a position where we were 100% sure that we can deal with the regulatory issues and could stand up the synergy numbers at I high level of robustness
  -0.10  0 There's obviously substantial synergies there, but it has implications for suppliers because they've got to be big enough to supply both of you
   0.50  0 So can you talk around all that, please?  I can have a go
   0.12  0 You can draw your own conclusions to what that might mean in terms of the relative pricing, quality, service, strategies of the 2 businesses
   0.00 -1 So let's not get into that
   0.10  0 It's worth emphasizing that 80% -- sorry, 85% of the volume of both businesses is concentrated in a 100 suppliers, and those 100 suppliers tend to be large multinational suppliers, not exclusively branded, but   nevertheless, large multinational and largely not exclusively branded suppliers, which is another important factor in thinking about how the synergies are delivered
   0.00  1 And so you could argue there's another throw of the dice above and beyond just equalization of terms, which is well, we're going to combine volumes, and therefore there's a future benefit from that
   0.00  1  Potentially, that's where the global sourcing capabilities of Walmart when it comes in to commodities could help support both businesses and both private label programs
  -1.00  0 3 questions for me
  -0.06  0 And in fact, I've often said that it's inevitable that it will in some shape or form and even before this transaction there's a whole series of things that have happened, Nisa and Co-op and Palmer & Harvey going bust, Tesco and Booker which are forms of market consolidation
  -0.11  0 And we can argue about the timing of it, but we believe that the timing is right, and that's at least in the context of the competition authorities
  -0.17  0 The CMA is a rational, logical organization, largely run by economists
   0.10  0 And what I would say is that all my experience would say that it is despite the fact you go through a process, you do get to an answer that you first thought of by the end of it
   0.14 -1 And it goes without saying that the market and the competitive environment is changing incredibly rapidly
   0.00 -1 And indeed, the support of both boards to come to pragmatic solutions to a whole series of potential hurdles when we were going through the machinations of bringing together 2 very substantial organizations, one of which is owned by a U.S
   0.00  1 So what I would say, and I hope this augers well for the future, both organizations, it's been a huge amount of cooperation, I mean, literally, in the last 48 hours, 2 teams have sat in the same room and knocked down a whole bunch of hurdles to get us to where we got to this morning and to be able to make the announcements we made, and that's a credit to a large number of people in this room, but it's also a credit to the approach of both organizations to getting to where we've got to
  -0.33  0 I've got 3 questions
  -0.08  0 And the reason I asked the question is just given that you are continuing to run 2 separate businesses, but there's not been a way of getting the upside without the execution risk
  -1.00  0 Second question is around Argos
  -0.17  0 And then the third question is on the sort of the health of the core Asda business
   0.29  0 So does that represent the start of a more stable profit outlook for Asda?    So if I have a go on the first 2, and then perhaps Roger can have a go at the third one
  -0.07  0 And so if you ended up having to structure a commercial arrangement for the other 20 things on the tick sheet of the things we could be doing together, I think it will just become almost -- we spent so much time in the lawyers offices to try to get those arrangements, I think it would just be impossible
   0.00  1  And I think that from Walmart's perspective, what we wanted to create, as I said, is a really strong U.K
   0.00  1 But the reason I want to keep 42%, which is still a very significant shareholding, is so that we can unlock value back into the business as well, into the Walmart business
  -0.06  1  As far as stores in stores are concerned, I think I'll say it again before, we'd like to draw a line to the GBP 160 million of synergies, we've delivered those more quickly than we said originally
   0.00  1 Hopefully, that augers well for the transaction that we're also talking about now
   0.00  1 So we delivered the synergies
  -0.33  0 I was just trying remember what question was
  -0.15  0 So the GBP 0.5 billion is net of disposal impact that you've worked out in your scenarios or what you think will be forced to sell as part of the conditions to for an approval?  Yes
   0.00  1  How much higher?  How much higher..
  -0.20  0 We haven't talked about disposals, but you could make an assumption about some level of disposals, but that's wrapped up the underlying number
   0.10  0 But as I say, we believe the case that we put today is pretty conservative in its assumptions that I've already talked about which is the buying synergy number and how that is calculated, and you could very easily get to a number which is substantially greater than that by making a different set of assumptions
  -0.03  0  Yes, I think my question to Judith was, can you just clarify comes 2020 I guess, Sainsbury/Asda or Sainsbury's or whatever it will be branded, we will have full access to the global sourcing capability of Walmart?  So yes, there is commercial agreement in place that gives that combined business access to global sourcing from the Walmart business, and that is over a defined period of time
   0.08  0    You'll have to have a -- well, actually, if the Asda standalone business today accessed global sourcing, there is effectively a fee that's paid on doing that
   0.20  0 Effectively even though we'd be a shareholder, so you'd expect us to do that
  -0.67  0 So next question, obvious question
   0.08  0 Why do you minimize the equity investment, the equity exposure to the deal?  It is actually we didn't want to take a controlling position
  -0.14  0 It gives us the objectives that I talked about in terms of independent U.K
   0.33 -1 You seem to be indicating that, that has begun to stabilize
  -0.09  0 And then thirdly, on the Bank, given the volatility of earnings you continue to allocate capital to the Bank, I think there's GBP 110 million next year, GBP 100 million per annum thereafter
  -0.06  0 And then lastly, just to help us with your accretion calculations, could you help with the cost of debt for the GBP 3 billion?  Well, I'll give out to Roger to answer the first question and then I'll probably answer in exactly the same way
   0.00  1 We've seen transaction growth throughout last   year
   0.00 -1 We talked about, for instance, recently almost 1,000 prices coming down
   0.00  1 And again, Sainsbury's as an independent business is confirming consensus today, which would imply earnings growth next year, which we believe is more than sustainable otherwise we wouldn't be saying it
   0.00 -1 And as far as the Bank is concerned, the Bank still is an opportunity, I mean, there were one-off charges within the numbers that we talked about
   0.00 -1 Although it's been longer and more expensive than we'd like, we have done it in a way that hasn't impacted our customers
   0.10  0 There are a few things that we are uncomfortable about, and we put our hands up and say there are some choices we made that we'd make it differently with benefit of hindsight
  -0.07  0 And maybe just give us some context on that, say in recent price investments from both of you have maybe been larger than 10% on the headline items you've cut
   0.08  0 And second one is just to confirm, maybe for Roger, do you say that you -- the outlook for the operating profit for Asda going forward is broadly flat versus what you delivered in '17?  Thanks, Rob
   0.08  0 And it goes without saying that if you think about the market dynamics, I think you can draw your own conclusions as to the type of products that you might be   investing in, in the future
  -1.00  0 Just have 2 questions
   0.11  0 But just on the system side of the equation, it's obviously, probably the highest risk component
   0.00 -1 I mean obviously, seen that slip up before specifically with Morrisons and Safeway
  -0.03  0 So why make the transition if Walmart is staying a long-term partner, why do you need to go down a risky route of integrating the supply chain? And the second is why the head offices staying fairly independent or is that going to explore at a later date?  Yes, I would argue that actually, it's probably the best way of running the business from a system's point of view
  -0.12  0 And so sort of back engineering Argos systems into Sainsbury's systems is near impossible
   0.14  0 So I'm sure there are opportunities in the future, which we kind of alluded to as we've had this conversation
   0.00  1 But certainly, we would all want to keep the brands feeling like they had separate customer-facing teams, making sure that we're doing the best thing for customers week-in, week-out for those businesses
   0.00  1 business
  -1.00  0 2 questions from me
  -0.08  0  We have to be very careful during the CMA process and the businesses have to trade independently and have to seen to be trading independently, and we would not do anything that would prejudice the CMA process
  -0.33  0 It won't be quite as blatant as that
  -0.11  0 We won't talk about these things, and we know the answer to the question in terms of what we think it will look like
  -0.21  0 But for the sake of this conversation, let's not speculate about doing anything in the next period of time whilst we see the transaction to completion because it will prejudice or has the potential to prejudice the CMA investigation
  -1.00  0  Second question
   0.04  0  And it's a bygone era 2000 -- it was year 2000 when Walmart took Asda, that I was part of the leadership team and the Walmart management said at the time, we're going to open doors [indiscernible] you come and choose, and that's exactly what the Asda team did at the time
  -0.25  0 Sorry, this has to be the last question I apologize, so make it a good one
   0.00 -1    No pressure there
  -1.00  0 I have 2 questions
  -0.12  0  I'll have a go obviously on the answer your first question, then maybe Judith would have a reflection on that
  -0.17  0 And I'll let her and Roger give you same answers already been given and what we may or may not choose to disclose
   0.05  0 But I think the structure means that we can give assurance to Sainsbury's shareholders that Walmart don't have voting control and there is enough weight on the other side with the other 70.1% of shares to give some sense of independence and the fact that the company will operate as an independent U.K
   0.00  1 But of course, with a 42%, it gives Walmart the significant economic stake in the future of the organization, and therefore, a significant amount of skin in the future game
   0.20  0 And I think, that's effectively what you said in your answer as well
  -0.04  0  The other question was just on how to treat the royalties, Asda/Walmart?  Yes, I mean, clearly, without giving any forward guidance on anything or looking aback, which I've got to be really careful with is there will be a change in the royalties and the structure that, that works, but that could will be replaced by some commercial fees to accessing some of the goods and services that are provided
  -0.50  0  Actually, last question
  -0.17  0 So I apologize as we mentioned, we've got quite a busy day
   0.00  1  Thank you

   0.14  0 320 million homes in a market worth of GBP 240 billion, split 60% home improvers, 40% light pro
   0.14  0 It remains a top spending priority and 65% did a home improvement project last year
   0.00  1 We are highly cash generative
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet remain strong, supported by GBP 3.5 billion of freehold property
   0.00  1 We are announcing today dividends up 4%, and we have continued to return surplus cash flow to shareholders via buybacks
   0.00  1 Over 1/3 of our ranges have now been unified and they are being well received by customers
   0.00  1 As we will talk to later, we are guiding to growth in unique and unified sales and higher gross margins next year
   0.00  1 Our digital initiatives are also gaining momentum as we enter the final year of rollout of our unified IT platform
  -0.33  0 And this disruption has different lenses
   0.08  0 And although we are investing in lower prices as we roll out our unified and unique ranges, this takes time to feed through and resonate with our customers as they do not naturally shop for home improvement that often
  -0.14  0 We are acting on the causes of this disruption and adapting our approach as necessary
   0.00  1 This has worked well
   0.00  1 Our business can support this   given our strong balance sheet
  -0.17  1 Our reality is that we have probably lost some customers, but we are working hard to reverse this
   0.00 -1 Karen will go into more detail on stock later, but I wanted to stress that this has been a conscious decision, and you have probably seen for yourselves that availability is starting to improve
   0.00 -1 This is indeed a tough time inside the business
   0.00 -1 We have our unified IT rollout, which puts pressure on some of our business functions
   0.00  1 Our score significantly exceeded both the retail benchmark, including companies like Nike and Home Depot, and the all-industry benchmark
   0.17  0 For our colleagues in stores, we launched a home improvement academy
   0.00  1 ONE learning experience, the first-ever company-wide learning event for store colleagues to ensure ONE customer experience
   0.00  1 It really feels to be like momentum is building with wider sharing
  -0.08  0 Concrete examples for me are OSC hosting our first ever group-wide own brand product show, where we also hosted our Capital Markets Day late last year
   0.00  1 This generated record internal Facebook yammer posting and comments and felt like a big step forward for the business in terms of wider sharing and support of the ONE Kingfisher strategy
   0.00 -1 is more uncertain
   0.07 -1 The market feels like it has become tougher as the year has progressed, as we have referenced from softer big-ticket sales in Q4 across both businesses, especially B&Q
   0.00  1 The backdrop in France is encouraging, though volatile
   0.00  1 Overall, despite the pace of change and the disruption we have been experiencing, we have delivered all our key strategic milestones for the second year in a row, and we have continued to return cash to our shareholders
   0.00 -1 On a constant currency basis, total group sales were broadly flat at GBP 11.7 billion, with like-for-like sales down 0.7%
   0.00 -1 At a group level, gross margins were down 20 basis points in constant currency
   0.17 -1 Retail profit of GBP 849 million was down 3.6% on a constant currency basis
   0.00 -1 This was mainly driven by the sales decline, partly mitigated by cost reduction initiatives, including GBP 28 million of goods not for resale benefits
   0.00  1 This included GBP 34 million of favorable currency impact
   0.07  0 Our effective tax rate increased by 4 percentage points to 30%, mainly reflecting the impact of a GBP 20 million corporate tax surcharge in France, which we do not expect to recur
   0.00 -1 Underlying earnings per share of 25.5p were down 0.4p, reflecting the adverse impact of the French tax surcharge, partly offset by a positive impact from the share buyback
   0.08 -1 Adjusted profit before tax of GBP 683 million was down 8%, reflecting a GBP 114 million of transformation cost charged to the P&L, up from GBP 44 million this time last year
   0.00 -1 This was lower than the GBP 130 million we guided to
   0.17 -1 Statutory profit before tax was down 10% to GBP 682 million, slightly more than the adjusted profit before tax, largely reflecting an exceptional gain of GBP 17 million in last year's comparative
   0.00 -1 At a group level, gross margins were down 20 basis points in constant currency, in line with our guidance at the start of the year of broadly flat
   0.00  1 This equates to 180 basis points of growth in gross margins from our unified and unique sales, reflecting cost price reduction in line with our plan
   0.07 -1 The gross margin on the rest of the business, including stronger foreign exchange headwinds in the U.K., was down 10 basis points overall
   0.18  0 I'd now like to describe the movement from underlying profit before tax, through to statutory profit before tax for the full year
   0.05  0 These transformation costs largely relate to the remerchandising work associated with introducing our unified and unique offer, including incremental in-store labor costs and point-of-sale change, and to the costs of improving our digital capability
   0.25  0 Adjusted profit is therefore GBP 683 million, which is before exceptional items
   0.12  0 After an overall net GBP 1 million exceptional charge, statutory profit before tax was GBP 682 million
   0.00 -1 This was below our guidance of GBP 30 million, mainly reflecting timing
   0.00  1 And we reflected a GBP 14 million exceptional gain, driven by the success of the B&Q store disposals that we talked about at the half year
  -0.10  1 and Ireland, like-for-like sales were up 0.6% with a 2.8% like-for-like sales decline at B&Q more than offset by 10.1% growth at Screwfix
   0.00  1   Digital sales grew 11% over the year with click & collect growing by nearly 90%, and digital sales now represent 4% of total sales
   0.50  0 We now have over 70 outlets in Greater London
   0.00  1 The more centrally located stores are typically smaller than average formats and demonstrate the adaptability of the Screwfix model and the ability to reach more customers
   0.00 -1 In quarter 4, however, we experienced softer like-for-like sales across both businesses with B&Q down 5% and Screwfix up 7%
   0.00 -1 In France, like-for-like sales were down 3.5% with Castorama like-for-like sales down 2.4% and Brico Depot down 4.8%
   0.00  1 In quarter 4, our like-for-like sales improved to broadly flat; however, the market has been volatile across the year
   0.00 -1 Retail profit was down 14.8% with the impact of weaker sales partly offset by good cost control
   0.00  1 In our established Other international businesses, Poland, Russia and Spain, like-for-like sales increased by 1.8%
  -0.11  1 Sales declined in Spain and Russia, but Poland had another good year with like-for-like sales up 5.3% despite some disruption, following good trading in a supportive market
   0.09  0 Romania delivered a profit of GBP 3 million versus breakeven last year, but this also includes 1 month's trading from the Praktiker acquisition
   0.00  1 The Praktiker acquisition more than doubles the size of our Romania business, giving us national reach and establishing us as the #2 player in the market
   0.10  0 As we integrate Praktiker into our ONE Kingfisher plan, we would expect the overall Romanian results to be broadly breakeven next year
   0.00 -1 Our key returns metric, leased adjusted return on capital employed, declined by 210 basis points from 12.5% to 10.4% this year, largely reflecting the impact on our profit of the increase in transformation costs, an increase in the tax rate driven by the one-off tax surcharge in France and higher working capital
   0.14  0 I am pleased to report that the board is proposing a final dividend of 7.5p
   0.00  1 This results in a full year dividend of 10.8p; a year-on-year increase of 4%, covered 2x by adjusted earnings and representing a dividend yield of 3%
   0.00  1 In addition to the ordinary dividends of GBP 231 million, we returned GBP 260 million to shareholders via share buyback, a GBP 60 million increase on last year, taking the cumulative amount to GBP 460 million of the GBP 600 million that we committed to return over the over the first 3 years of our 5-year plan
  -0.17  0 The impact of this stock increase on cash flow breaks down into 3 main elements
   0.11 -1 For the time being, our reality is that we're not currently getting the benefit of having fewer SKUs across the business
   0.00  1 New unified ranges increased stock by further GBP 85 million
   0.00  1 Given the disruption that we have encountered, we took a decision to de-risk our customer experience by carrying some mitigation stock, focused on improving product availability for our customers
   0.00  1 Our strong balance sheet supports this course of action
   0.10  0 To summarize the year, our gross margin performance was in line with our expectations with the benefits of buying as ONE really starting to come through
   0.00  1 Our balance sheet remains strong and able to support   volatility despite the working capital outflow this year, and we're continuing to return surplus cash to shareholders, as planned
   0.00  1 So as I said earlier, we've delivered all our key strategic milestones for the second year in a row
   0.00  1 However, not that we could labor this before, not having any tangible products to show you, but the reality is that our plan is about higher gross margins and higher sales; higher sales driven by unique ranges
   0.00  1 I am seeing early tangible evidence of delivery
   0.00  1 Unified and unique sales are growing
   0.00  1 Gross margins, in this case pre-clearance, are also growing, up 180 basis points, and this is after some price investment where it is needed
   0.00  1 As you heard earlier from Karen, our price investments in France are gaining traction
   0.00 -1 Global SKU numbers and suppliers' numbers are coming down by around 80% through a fair and open tendering process
   0.00 -1 Of our 7 categories, like bathroom and storage or building and joinery, excluding clearance, 5 out of 7 categories have grown sales overall and 2 were slightly down
   0.00 -1 Sales overall for the group, though, are down 0.3%, as Karen referred to earlier
   0.00  1 As I said on the previous slide, our plan is about driving growth, driving higher sales, and we are seeing this happen in the numbers, even if it's early days
  -0.10  0 Unified ranges are ranges where we're simply rationalizing the number of individual SKUs and suppliers, like kitchen taps as an example
   0.00  1 And we can see that growth in unique ranges are ahead of unified
   0.00 -1 This does not surprise me at all
   0.00  1 Unique bathroom furniture is up 39%, well ahead of the entire category
   0.00  1 In time, the more unique we have in the mix, which implicitly takes longer to materialize, the more this will drive our overall sales
   0.00  1 Gross margins on unified and unique ranges are up everywhere, overall up 180 basis points excluding clearance
   0.00  1 So unique first
   0.00  1 You can see here that the whole category is up 11% at a group level, and it is being driven by the performance of unique
   0.11  0 We know, through our deep understanding of customer insights, that customer needs are more similar than they are different
   0.00  1 In the U.K., sales have doubled from a low base
   0.00  1 Sales of showers have also performed well across all key markets
   0.00  1 In total, gross margins are up on unified and unique ranges by 180 basis points
   0.00  1 However, this category, which has a higher proportion of unique, has even higher gross margin
   0.00  1 That's good news for the evolution of our gross margin
   0.00  1 So unique drives sales and margin
   0.14  0 This product, as you will know, is bought by home improver and pros and is a critical product, nobody wants a poor seal, but generally not easy for home improvers to shop
   0.00 -1 Well, this was only implemented in H2, but even so, sales are slightly ahead excluding clearance, selling prices are 3% lower overall for customers
   0.00  1 Gross margins are up, as you would expect
   0.20  0 We now have market leading 1-hour click & collect in all stores
   0.00  1 Group online sales are now at 6%, up on last year, driven by B&Q, which has grown from 3% to 4% and in Screwfix up from 25% to 28%
   0.11  0 Click & collect remains the most popular channel, representing 55% of digital sales, the 45% balance from home delivery
  -0.10  1 Click & collect is, however, B&Q's faster growing channel, up from 15% last year, no doubt helped by its own 1-hour click & collect
   0.00  1 France remains at 1% digital sales, though, as Karen mentioned earlier, conversion since launch of Castorama's website is up around 20%
   0.00  1 Since launch, the B&Q app is delivering higher ATV and conversion
   0.00  1 In terms of desktop, we are building our group capability to be as quick and agile as mobile
   0.14  0 This is now available on the B&Q website and is proving popular
   0.11  0 Now on to operational efficiency, which will contribute GBP 100 million of the overall GBP 500 million, driven by goods not for resale
   0.17  0 ONE Kingfisher means we'll collaborate and do things together once, and this program is an evidence of that
   0.00  1 For the second year in a row, we've delivered ahead of our target milestone
   0.00  1 And HR services, we are now -- have ONE tender approach across areas such as recruitment and learning and development, generating a 10% saving
   0.00  1 Firstly, our strategic milestones
   0.00  1 Unique and unified offer; our target is to move from 23% unified cost of goods sold to 40% and to deliver growth in unified and unique sales
   0.00  1 I speak to our already high engagement scores versus the retail sector
   0.25  0 So just a couple of slides now covering our offer and efficiency
   0.00  1 Unified and unique, another big year, another big year of physical change and clearance
   0.00  1 As I said before, unique ranges are expected to drive sales growth as they have started to last year
   0.00  1   You can also expect to see more of the wider bathroom project as we start to implement sanitary, including our first rimless toilet, at an amazing entry market price
   0.17  0 I will leave you to work out, however, what the benefits are to customers of a rimless toilet
   0.00  1 It builds on the already strong Kingfisher own brand heritage in Brico Depot
   0.33  0 In fact, so popular in France, it even has a fan club
   0.50  0 And of course, all at great prices
   0.00  1 We do expect that our own brand participation in this range to be higher than it was previously, to build to around 2/3 over the next 18 months from where it is today at 45%
   0.00 -1 The unification process reduced our global SKU count by over 80%, from over 8,500 overall SKUs to under 1,500
   0.00  1 This in turn allowed us to review our merchandising, helping customers buy the right tool for the job without overwhelming them with too much choice
   0.17  0 Now less from me, let's listen to our teams talking about this great new range
   0.00 -1 We have so far had little shared services capability beyond IT
   0.12  0 We opened a shared service center in Krakow, Poland last year, Krakow being the European center of excellence for shared services
   0.10  0 And work is underway to unlock further operational efficiency initiatives, which we will update you on in due course
   0.00  1 So as I have said a few times today, we are in this phase of building the ONE Kingfisher engine that provides the platform for growth
   0.00  1 We are rolling out our unified and unique offer, as you know, and this continues into this year, leveraging our group scale
   0.00  1 Going forward, this new engine provides the platform for growth
   0.00  1 Our unified and unique offer will provide growth, driven by our unique ranges
   0.00  1 Many would be envious of what we have today
   0.07  0 This assumes that the cost price reduction benefits we will generate from unifying 40% of cost of goods sold outweigh the combination of clearance costs and net price investment
  -0.09  0 And given we're not planning to open any further Screwfix Germany outlets until we have completed our unified IT rollout, we expect the losses to be similar to last year
   0.06 -1 Transformation costs and exceptional charges, excluding estate transformation, both sit below underlying profit and both form part of our GBP 800 million total transformation cost guidance
   0.00  1 For this financial year, we believe that our profit and loss transformation costs will be up to GBP 130 million, reflecting another significant year of transformation activity
   0.07  0 And they also include costs associated with our digital activity, covering both our work in upgrading our e- commerce capability and in launching new home improvement services
   0.00  1 Our guidance on the exceptional costs of transformation for this year is GBP 50 million
   0.00  1 This leaves close to GBP 300 million for years 4 and 5 of the plan, mostly exceptional costs and CapEx
   0.00  1 We are also reaffirming that we expect to deliver the GBP 500 million EBIT uplift by '20-'21 and to complete the remaining GBP 140 million of the GBP 600 million return of capital by the end of this year
  -0.12  1 I don't think any of you underestimate the scale of our ambition, but it is the right ambition, the right strategy
   0.00  1 Thank you for listening

  -0.08  0 There are no fire drills planned, please turn mobiles off and the standard disclaimers apply to forward-looking statements
   0.00  1 2017 financial highlights were formidable
   0.00  1 PBT also up by 32% to GBP 2.09 billion
   0.00  1 EPS up 50% to 31.87p and ROE of 25.6%
   0.00  1 This led to an additional GBP 250 million of dividends from our LGAS entity to group, increasing remittances
   0.00  1 Legal & General is strongly cash generative, with net release from our continuing operations also up 9% to GBP 1.4 billion
   0.25  0 And we are structured to enable cash to flow easily up to group without trap cash [ of ] capital in subsidiaries
   0.00  1 I would, of course, like to thank all of my colleagues and thanks particularly to Steve Ellis who's sitting in the second row here and the team in our lifetime mortgage business
   0.00  1 This slide captures medium-term trends in our financial performance, showing consistent delivery of strong financial metrics
   0.00  1 You should also note that book value per share has also grown by 7% and grew 13% last year, so in 2017, 7% DPS growth coupled with 13% increase in book value per share was over 20%
   0.11  0 Although we have reported a 32p of earnings per share, if you take off the effects of the 2017 mortality release and the one-off change in the U.S
   0.00  1 tax rates, we delivered a 23.1p of EPS and 9% growth on last year, which is in line of our stated long-term EPS ambition
  -0.14  0 This has included decluttering or disposing of subscale legacy of nonstrategic businesses
   0.00  1 We have significantly reshaped the group over the past few years to a simple, focused, modern business model
   0.00  1 This reshaping has allowed us to redefine our strategy
   0.10  0 The strategy is effective in 3 broad business areas: Investing and Annuities, Investment Management and Insurance
   0.00  1 And in 2017, we demonstrated how we were able to use them for customers, for shareholders and for society
   0.00  1 Jeff?  Thank you, and good morning, everyone
   0.10  0 I'm going to run through the financials for the year, our dividend and capital position, before handing back to Nigel for more on the group strategy and Q&A
   0.08  0 As we flagged at the half year, we reviewed our longevity improvements assumptions, and we moved to an adjusted version of the next actuarial table, CMI '15
   0.00  1   Our key divisions performed strongly in 2017, contributing to the 9% increase in net release from continuing operations
   0.00  1 When added together, this means the group generated GBP 1.7 billion total release, up 21% in 2016
   0.00  1 On internal dividends, the cash remitted to group in respect to 2017's results was up 46% from last year at GBP 1.6 billion
   0.00  1 This net surplus generation will continue to grow over time
   0.00  1 The board took into account the strong 2017 results, together with the medium-term underlying business prospects and has therefore announced a full year dividend of 15.35p, which is 7 -- up 7% from the previous year
   0.00  1 Our institutional LGR business, which deals with the corporate pension scheme, grew 39% on a reported basis and after excluding the mortality release, it was a strong 10%
   0.00  1 New distribution arrangements as the preferred provider of Annuities to Aegon and other DC platforms helped drive this
   0.00 -1 And finally, GI contributed GBP 37 million, down GBP 15 million from 2016, predominantly due to the impact of increased costs from escape of water in line with industry experience as we reported at half year
   0.17  0 We've already covered the 13% operating profit growth, even without the mortality releases
   0.08 -1 Our total Annuities of GBP 4.6 billion, with a new business value-add of 8.5%, was achieved through the regulatory capital strain of less than 4% which is within our target low to mid-single-digit range
   0.10  0 For the mortality release, I want to illustrate how our change in assumptions in respect to future improvements drove the GBP 206 million that you see
   0.00 -1 As you know, at half year, we decided to release GBP 126 million of prudence in our reserves in light of the continuing higher number of actual deaths we experienced compared to expectations
   0.06  0 On the back of further analysis of our own mortality experience and the trends we have been seeing, we've also decided to move to an adjusted version of the next actuarial model, CMI '15, for our longevity improvement assumptions
   0.11  0 These adjustments are made to reflect how our annuitants differ from the broader population and apply some smoothing
   0.11  0 Moving to CMI '15 simply assumes that you'll experience slightly lower improvements in getting there
  -0.06  0 Going forward, we will continue to scrutinize the likelihood of a sustained slowdown in mortality improvement of population data and that on our own book emerges and consider whether to make further changes to our best estimate assumptions
  -0.25  0 This table breaks down the new business sales in LGR
   0.00  1 bulk annuities in 2017, as demand remains strong with GBP 1.4 billion of this transferring from LGIM clients, giving further evidence of the unique breadth of pension derisking solutions we can offer clients
   0.00  1 pension plans remains substantial and the pipeline of transactions we are in active discussions with has risen to GBP 17 billion
   0.00  1 Our LGR Retail business had a particularly strong year with new Individual Annuity business up 78% due to the new distribution agreement and demand continuing to return to this market
   0.00  1 The market has a potential to grow rapidly with GBP 1.5 trillion of U.K
  -0.22  1 The asset portfolio backing our annuity liabilities has expanded its range and diversity in 2017 and remains defensive in nature
   0.17  0 20% of the portfolio is in sovereign-like assets and over 2/3 of it is A-rated or better
  -0.17  0 In addition, we continue to have a GBP 2.7 billion credit default reserve held against it
   0.20  0 We now have 17% of the portfolio in direct investments with stable income, often collateralized or secured on great counterparties
   0.00  1 LGIM had a year of strong growth with record external net flows of GBP 43.5 billion, which is 5% of opening AUM and GBP 33 billion of this from international clients
   0.00  1 We continue to grow our U.K
   0.00  1 with good growth in the past year and the market leader in workplace master trust
   0.00  1 retail business is also growing rapidly with record net inflows of GBP 3 billion and ranking third in net flows for the second consecutive year
   0.00  1 business contributes significantly to this with assets of $189 billion across an expanding range of strategies of 350 clients
   0.00  1 DB market has [been to] increasingly implement LDI strategies and consistent strong performance in our range of active fixed income funds and now complemented by a more recently established index team and DC proposition
   0.00  1 Our acquisition announced in November of Canvas, the ETF platform, will provide clients with access to one of the fastest- growing segments in asset management, broadening our geographical reach and product range
   0.00  1 In the Gulf, we have GBP 3.6 billion of net inflows and now have GBP 36 billion of assets as we deepen our relationships in this region
   0.00  1 As well as broadening our U.K
  -0.08  1 In the direct portfolio, a combination of asset disposals and sales of funds generated GBP 369 million of proceeds, exceeding the target of GBP 250 million for 2017
  -0.17  1 And importantly, our disposals during the year met our return expectations of at least 10% to 12% IRR
   0.17  0 For LGI, operating profits for the division as a whole was flat year-on-year
   0.00  1 protection grew 5% with good premium growth of 8% and favorable mortality experience
   0.00  1 Protection remained robust in a competitive environment
   0.00  1 In GI, gross premiums increased 13% to GBP 369 million whilst maintaining our pricing discipline in a competitive market
   0.00 -1   As [ the slide shows here ], our operating profit was affected predominantly by the impact of increased costs from escape of water claims in Q1
   0.00  1 We took action to address this and saw improved claims experience in the second half, as can be seen by the 92% combined ratio
   0.00  1 These factors combine to give good prospects for growth in 2018
   0.00  1 On savings, the team did a great job in delivering the 2017 results amid a few distractions
   0.14  0 The profits of over GBP 400 million will be recognized when the Part 7 completes, which is targeted for mid-2019
   0.33  0 Moving to our capital position
  -0.14  0 The group Solvency II surplus increased GBP 1.2 billion since the last year-end to GBP 6.9 billion
  -0.14  1 Our Solvency II coverage ratio, calculating our shareholder basis, increased to 189%, up from 171% last year
   0.00  1 Our economic capital showed similar growth over the last year, as expected
  -0.12  0 We have expanded our usual Solvency II surplus bridge to explain the GBP 1.2 billion total movement over the year
   0.00  1 As we guided, our operational surplus generation has increased to GBP 1.3 billion
   0.17 -1 The impacts of writing new business in the year was a very capital efficient strain of less than GBP 100 million
  -0.13  0 And similarly on Solvency II, our usual slide gives you our estimate of the present value of Solvency II surplus emergence from the key elements of the new business we wrote
   0.00  1 As we have already noted, our margins continue to be resilient whilst maintaining pricing discipline
   0.00  1 This is in line with our previous EPS guidance and an indication of our ongoing ambition
  -0.09  0 On longevity, we maintained our prudent and staged approach to the trends we are seeing, and will investigate to move to CMI '16 in light of our 2017 experience
   0.25  0 I will now hand back to Nigel to go into more detail on these growth opportunities
   0.00  1 I'm very proud and privileged to be the CEO of Legal & General
   0.00  1   Record annuity assets, record assets under management and record insurance premiums
   0.00  1 Our strategy begins with our 6 long-term growth drivers which are highly relevant and drive continued growth here at Legal & General
   0.08  0 The aging demographics, combined with tension and welfare reform is still leading to the significant DB to DC shift, which continues to gather pace
   0.00  1 We're highly focused on the whole DB journey from LGIM -- LDI products to buy-ins and buyouts at LGR and providing the direct investment to deliver the returns expected by our policyholders and our shareholders
   0.00  1 We're also actively growing in DC, both in the U.K
   0.00  1 Having exited from some businesses, we can really concentrate our attention and energies on those that can make a real difference and deliver our unique model of inclusive capitalism
   0.00  1 And in Investment Management, we continue to build out our world-class international businesses
   0.00  1 Savings gap by growing our retail investments and Workplace Savings businesses
   0.00  1 The numbers Jeff took you through show we are very capable capitalists, but what we do also meets real customer and real societal needs
   0.00  1 In LGR, Chris has terrific plans to further broaden our individual annuity franchise within this important area, delivering complete retirement solutions
   0.08  0 LGC will take [ some ] investments, outright ownership or equity stakes, but only if they satisfy our return criteria and are consistent with our strategy
   0.00  1 And I'd like to thank Kerrigan for taking on this exciting new challenge
   0.00  1 DB pensions, LGIM's strategy today is focused on 3 things: broadening our investment capability, growing globally and expanding our U.K
  -0.25  0 We have no legacy problems on the upside
   0.12  0 And we're taking a global lead on ESG, more of our inclusive capitalism
   0.12  0 Our insurance business goal is to be a fully digital and data-enabled insurer
  -0.10  0 For instance, SmartQuote for GI where we offer executable quotes after only 5 questions by using big data
   0.25  0 And as Jeff mentioned, we are already winning partnership business because of it
   0.00  1 Providing institutional and corporate clients with consistent solutions across LGIM and LGR using assets sourced by LGIM and LGC, leveraging our workplace customer base to offer products from across the group and creating a single customer interface for over 10 million customers within My Account to provide access to retirement, savings and insurance solutions
   0.00  1 The refocusing of our business puts growth in the U.S
   0.00  1 LGIM has delivered strong growth in client numbers, including some of the largest U.S
   0.00  1 LGR, with a strong pipeline in a market where only 4% of the $3.7 trillion of DB liabilities have transacted so far
   0.00  1 It is truly amazing that to date, we haven't created an institutional asset class in-housing in the U.K
  -0.07  0 for high-quality institutionally owned rental accommodations, a classic case of fixing a market failure and using our commercial strength to help tackle a societal problem
  -0.20  0 It's not just the millennials who face a housing shortage, but older people too
   0.00  1 It is also crucial to use data to improve the customer experience, which is what we do in GI through SmartQuote and SmartClaims
   0.00  1 We have clear strategic goals we are delivering on
  -0.67  0 Can we limit everybody to 3 questions at the most
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -0.20  0 And then third question is, perhaps for Jeff, so you're saying the longevity release in 2018 will be the same as 2017
  -1.00  0  Well, you can correct that
   0.00  1 But he was getting points of correction from Mark Zinkula, so it's on actuary and issues, which is the first time, so all that training that he's had to go through for several years are beginning to show a benefit
   0.10  0 We received that on the 2nd of January, and as Jeff mentioned, that will result in over GBP 400 million of profit being credited to the P&L in 2019
  -0.25  1 Hence, the cash balance keeps going up and up and up and with the disposals, it goes up even further
   0.12  0 I hope this year, he actually gets on and does one of them because we need a greater direct investment capability in the United States
  -0.18  1 And yes, the Solvency II ratio is pretty close to 200%, but we like   having a particularly strong balance sheet, and we've never had targets for our Solvency II ratio
  -0.20  0 Now Jeff, can you ask -- answer that third tricky question?  Yes
   0.00 -1 We were waiting for our 2017 data to be fully developed
   0.14  0 But of course, we're not in a position today to say, we will just mechanically plug it in because we smooth out data to make sure there aren't blips in it
   0.00 -1 But we see the trends, and we believe there is a medium- to long-term slowdown in mortality improvement in the short term
  -0.08  0 So both of our senior audit partners smiling that you've made the correct answer to the question on that, which will keep them both happy
   0.00 -1 So I'm wonder if you're holding some prudence back here
  -0.20  0 And as far as the second question is on retail annuities
  -0.29  0 I'm going to let Chris answer the second question, and Jeff's going to have yet another go at answering the first question
   0.17 -1 And there is more uncertainty about how wealth is impacting future improvement developments
   0.00  1 Yes, we see the open market continuing to grow
   0.00  1 The whole market grew modestly sort of in 2017 up again over the last 2 years, and we've seen 100,000 people coming to retirement every year going forward
  -0.25  1 With more DC money, rather than [ DP ] encumbered, we see that potential to grow
   0.00 -1 I think the introduction of PS 17 12 is also going to have an impact
   0.00 -1 So we'll have to see what that does
  -0.11  0 How do you feel about the divergence of these and can they increase in coverage over time?  Mark, you've got 2 questions to answer
  -0.25  0 I think this is the first time you've had 2 questions back-to-back
   0.00  1 And thank you
   0.00  1 So that's -- again, there will still be a lot of lumpiness in the DB part of the business, but again the underlying trends are still very favorable for a business model very broadly
   0.00  1 As I pointed out earlier, we're doing very well
   0.07  0 In the U.K., retail market now we're now expanding into Europe and ETFs are becoming increasingly popular in Europe for a variety of reasons, which I'll go into if you're interested in more detail
   0.00  1 And we think we have the right partner
   0.17  0 It's not a conscious decision to improve coverage ratios or anything else
   0.33  0 And we continue to review the position
   0.25  0 The board will continue to review the position across a range of metrics
   0.00  1 We genuinely believe that's our ambition around growth, and we think that's a sensible place to set the dividend at this stage
   0.00  1 Obviously, very strong new business surplus, and you've referenced the contribution from direct investments and lifetime mortgages
  -0.06  0 There's a speech from the DRI last week referencing their scrutiny around use of matching adjustments, internally rated assets, and you've, obviously, talked about the scope to take that further
   0.14  0 I was just wondering how -- if you could tell us a bit more about your risk appetite in that context, please
   0.11  0 Obviously, with the decision to set out of investments and crystallize cash, there's a trade-off with profits to a certain extent
   0.11  0 I know some is being reinvested and recycled, but could you give us a sense of that trade off going forward, please?  Okay
  -0.29  0 I don't think we've ever given out the numbers as to what's encumbered and not encumbered given the model
  -0.17  0 And then Kerrigan, can you answer the LGC question?  So Simon, we presented before about all of our direct investments
   0.00  1 We -- the primary aim is to make sure that they are a good match to our liabilities and make sure that all the risks underneath them are properly assessed
  -0.04  1 The matching adjustment process, which was referred to in the question, and I happened to get approval from the PRA to any asset that goes into that portfolio really ups the game in terms of making sure that there is really rigorous assessment of the risks, that the cash flows are as fixed as possible so that they are a good match for liabilities
  -0.15  0 There's only -- there's a limit to how much ultimately we can have in direct investments back in annuities, but we're a long way away from that at the moment because of the liquid nature of those liabilities
  -0.12  1 We've got plenty more scope to increase that without encumbering any liquidity issues
   0.11  0 And it was great to see in Cardiff that the -- there were 2 European investment firms who bought the assets and a Canadian firm who bought it in Bracknell
   0.00  1 That actually these would have wide international institutional appeal, which is something we found to be unexpected, but actually beneficial to us as a company
   0.00  1 Secondly, on LGIM, again, performing very well, on flows, on earnings, also the cash remittances are up, I think, for the first time since 2014, with a payout of 76%
   0.20  0 So just thinking about how that progression and the payout from here, given it had come down a little bit prior to this year
   0.11  0 And then finally on the subsidiary cash remittance, you provided enhanced disclosure on that, so thank you for that
   0.00  1 The thing we are trying to flag is we have over 20% in sovereigns and moving from sovereigns to [ new ] area to direct investments is -- or lifetime mortgages is a phenomenal trade for us and hugely value creating
  -0.17  0 But I don't know whether you want to add anything to that or take that very complicated last question or whether you want to take one off-line as to what the remittances are going to be, the mix of remittance
   0.00  1 Start of '17, we would have doubled that
  -0.08  0 And just on -- adding on the annuity and new business margin, et cetera, I mean, it was sort of following up from the previous question as well
   0.11  0 As an in force portfolio and overall, we believe there's plenty of headroom in that and that we could easily have 30 or the 40 [ as an answer to that ]
   0.00  1 And as lifetime mortgage grows, we grow in new business, we grow the total book
  -0.20  0 We can allocate this DI that we [ would have added to the ] in force [ or through ] new business
  -0.25  1 And because we have that optionality with in force, we can maintain the pricing discipline
  -0.06  1 So we're very focused on the right new business, added value, the right returns on economic capital and know we can apply to the in force if we need to
   0.05  0 And rest assured, there'll be a huge amount of remittances again this year because we hadn't realized the sensitivity of some of the elements to exactly making sure that we don't have trapped cash or trapped capital in the divisions
   0.20 -1 So we recognize we didn't succeed last year in convincing all of you
  -1.00  0 Two questions
  -0.17  0 And the second question is on the risk margin for the annuity business
   0.00  1 There's a good chance the PRA is going to maybe change the rules there, allow you to have some flexibility
  -0.12  1 Or actually, you found that the reinsurance is so cheap you might keep that going forward?  They're both very good questions
  -0.17  0 So we would expect there would be somewhat of an uptick, but we don't expect persistency to go down
   0.33  0  Actually, I love the answer to the next one, it depends
   0.50  0 Yes, but it does depend
   0.12  0 We've always said that it entirely depends how much any risk margin reduction would be, and we will then review
   0.00  1 The reinsurance remains very good value for both parties
   0.00  1 And we have a good supply
  -0.50  0 Two questions on your numbers
   0.00 -1 I was surprised at the jump in annuity margin, and I'm talking about on your new business release basis
  -0.11  0 And it's really -- answering the preceding question, it's the ratio that we have in the U.K
   0.14  0 PRT business which may well change going forward depending on what percentage [ is on those ]
   0.11  0 And if you want to be really technical about this, Tim Stedman -- [ gave ] an incomprehensible answer to Jeff and I last night, which was, depends
   0.50  0 And you can do the depends sensitivity with Tim afterwards
  -0.07  0 We look at each case on an individual basis, depends how much deferred and in-payment is in a transaction and what the pricing is, especially on deferred reinsurance where it's available
  -0.09  0 In terms of [ certainty ], we don't -- we haven't been explicit on how much we're allocating to new business versus in-force
   0.17  0 I mean, some of the useful metrics is we carried over more DI than we had the previous year, and so we could have allocated a lot more if we want to make them look better, and we effectively warehoused some of that
  -0.05  0 If you're writing deferred and you have lifetime mortgages, that is a reasonable pickup on yield compared to any other assets we'd be sourcing at the very long tail, big impact, long-duration, high-yield pickup, so that has an impact on that
   0.06  0  Laura, do you want pick up the bits that Jeff missed out on what the -- how warehousing works, which I think a lot of you haven't fully covered and the -- what opportunities are in the DI space moving forward?  Yes, sure
   0.00  1 I mean, I think Jeff -- on Jeff's slide, he was very clear about the relative proportion of direct investment on lifetime mortgages in our portfolio, growing over the year as the size of our book grew
  -0.11  0 And the diversity point is a really key point throughout -- the direct investments have now made the flow business
   0.00  1 Or -- and as Simon mentioned, we're well below our risk appetite at the moment
   0.00 -1 It's a very crowded space
  -0.14  0 So I was wondering whether we should think about ETFs differently for you given your expense base, is the first question
   0.00  1 You've been so well known in that sort of index space
   0.00  1 And what struck us is how well the residents would all talk to customers around there, and these values and behaviors of the firm are really highly regarded
   0.00  1 And so we've had demand pull ahead of the infrastructure
  -0.20  0 Mark, do you want to answer the 3 questions?  Yes, absolutely
  -0.67  1 No, the related questions are very good questions
   0.00  1 But this is the direction of travel, and we want to be, we are, I think, right now but it's early days, a market leader in developing products that are going to meet evolving investor demand
  -0.20  0 Vanguard was a late entrant in the U.S
   0.00  1 And we have a very strong index brand, a very strong passive brand
   0.00  1 So we do believe that we can enter the market, not starting as a top 5 provider, but grow rapidly over the next several years
  -0.50  0 I think I covered all the questions
  -0.25  0 I've got a couple of questions
  -0.06  0 First of all, in terms of the lifetime mortgage market, I wonder if you could just give us a view in terms of the outlook and also maybe comments on any potential regulatory concerns, [ over the passage of] [indiscernible] early
  -0.25  0 And the second question I had was in respect to the credit default reserve, which I presume has got no drawdown during the year
  -0.33  0  I addressed that question 5 years ago, Barrie
  -0.25  0 We almost never had to draw down on the default reserve
  -0.14  0 And so if anybody's got a lot of detailed questions, then Steve will be around afterwards so he can answer them
   0.00  1 We actually really try our best to go way beyond the sort of regulatory compliance minimum to make sure the customer is getting really good value for money
   0.00 -1 That's not a big -- not even been a small issue really for us
  -0.14  0 You see some people living in houses that are tiny, unsuitable for them, and we can help them fix the house up and make it livable rents, rent it all out and so forth
  -0.20  0 So whether it's -- so for separated, divorce being an issue, people living without children
  -0.33  1  As you can see, we're quite passionate about that
  -0.08  0 First one is a numbers question on the figure you show on slide -- the mortality basis slide, where you show the CMI '15 impact of 65 and 23.5
   0.15  0 And it sounds like you put an extra smoothing factor on top of the base CMI stuff because you talked about smoothing
   0.20  0 So if you used a different smoothing, it just went to the CMI, which you can do
  -0.50  0 And the second question is a more strategic one
   0.00  1 So maybe you could help us out as to how you're going to grow the earnings by 10% [ per annum ]
  -0.33  0  That was also a question we were asked 5 years ago
  -0.25  0 Bernie, maybe you want to take the first question here
   0.23  0 But yes, as we said earlier, we do apply smoothing [ to it ] -- we apply smoothing to our own data, we apply smoothing to how we bring the CMI tables in
   0.00 -1 I think given the great work that Steven, the team did in 2017 in group protection, I'd be disappointed if we didn't get 10% growth in the group protection business
   0.00  1 So when we come here next year, Steve will be standing proudly and telling you we didn't hit the [ track ] in 2018
   0.50  0 It depends how much we convert in that
   0.00  1 And the point that I think Jeff and I were trying to get across was we have a lot of pricing discipline around that
   0.10  0 So we're not going to chase any particular individual transaction because we have an ever increasing breadth of opportunities that we've been presented in the market
   0.00  1 But we certainly have enough risk appetite, capital and direct investments to support a pretty high level of growth in 2018 from the size of the back books that we've got
   0.19  0 But lifetime mortgages, I want to use Jeff's answer about depends again, because it depends on the mix of that business, so it very much depends on how much your average loan-to-value is on that portfolio
  -0.11  0 We're trying to keep that down to as low as possible so that we've got the bandwidth to offset volatility in house prices
   0.14  0 Also, I think there was mention about a new product that we're launching in that space where effectively, the borrower pays the interest, carries [ upon the ] interest where their -- effectively, you're are a lot more..
   0.10  0 So yes, it would depend on the mix of business as to how much we can -- but we are very on top of being very prudent about our assumptions about future house price inflation
  -0.15  0 We're trying to figure out how to answer this question yesterday, and since Simon obviously didn't hear the answer, Bernie will answer the other question
  -0.08  0 And we've got lower lapses, that's just in later durations, and on our level term business and the whole of life business
  -0.25  0 The claims and quite a bit of our insurance premiums go up, and so it's just a mechanical fact
   0.11 -1 If we get people happy to stay with us, we actually make slightly less money, and so it's just a kind of minor impact
  -0.10  0 So [ we're talking, you know, ] like a level term -- long-term persistency rates, you were seeing that rate at 3.3% going to 3.1%
  -0.67  0 So it's quite a tiny change in lapses
   0.00  1 And yes, we hope customers carry on wanting to give us premiums and remaining in force, and we'll be doing what we can to keep them happy
  -0.14  0 So yes, that's what's going on broadly with the lapses and the figures are in the pack
   1.00  0  The price of success
  -1.00  0 Last 2 questions
  -0.25  0  I'll let Laura pick up the second question there
   0.00  1 On the first question, just in general, on DI, you're right in the sense that it will be terrific for us to see interest rates go up [indiscernible] even stronger than [ it is ] yesterday
   0.00  1 I think there is just a huge demand for new assets across the U.K
   0.14  0 [ I'm not going to give ourselves an efficient ] rating, [ which has ] now gone from C- to D+
   0.00  1 Probably the best environment we've had for 30 years
   0.09  0 It's still a C+, but it's moving towards a B in terms of how much better it's getting here in the U.K
  -0.12  0 [ Pretty ] quite different to our competitors because of the in-house capability we have through LGIM Real Assets and LGC
   0.11  0 And really worth reiterating that we've -- I think we've really only just begun to scratch the surface of the opportunity that we have through LGC
   0.00  1 And if you think about the other sectors that we've chosen to invest in, housing and clean energy, both of those have huge potential for the long-term financing and creating investments that will fit our annuity liabilities
   0.00  1  One of the key messages is this capability
  -0.33  0 Last question?  Angel Kansagra from HSBC
  -0.09  1 So -- because it's quite strong to see that the operating capital generation cash remittance comfortably cover the dividend, but to just see what the divisions are contributing, that would be useful
  -0.16  0 Have you thought of taking any action on your credit portfolio, in particular, utilities?    I'll answer the third question, which is one of my specialist topics, but I'll let those really difficult first 2 question pass to my colleague, Jeff Davies
   0.00 -1 So I think that's the issue
   1.00  0 We will be as transparent as we can around this
   0.00 -1 So that gives you the negative within rights of [ the ] other business like LGI, which creates positives and offsets and brings you back to the less than GBP 100 million number that we quoted, the total across the group
  -0.11  0 In respect of utilities, quite a lot of utilities are actually in America because the BBB rated American utilities
   0.25  0 And then enthusiastic response to that now is I congratulate them on that
   0.00  1 So thank you

  -0.10  0 We will spend the next hour going through the 2017 results, including time for questions, before moving on to the strategic update
   0.20  0 You'll be hearing from a number of the leadership team later
   0.00  1 With our strong capital generation, we are already at this level
   0.00  1 This represents a 46% increase on total returns to shareholders versus last year, amounting to up to GBP 3.2 billion
   0.00  1 Statutory profit before tax increased 24% year-on-year to GBP 5.3 billion from a negative GBP 600 million in 2012
   0.09  0 And as the below-the-line charges reduce in future years, we expect the gap between statutory and underlying profits and returns to continue to close
   0.00 -1 economy
   0.00  1 We see an economy that is resilient and continues to benefit from the tailwinds of continuous GDP growth and deleveraging in recent years, with unemployment also at a 40- year low
   0.00  1 We expect the employment rate to continue growing in 2018, further supporting consumption
   0.00 -1 On the other hand, pay growth remains below inflation, which causes pressure on household finances
   0.33 -1 Despite the U.K
  -0.05  1 continuing to run a current account deficit, exports are now growing consistently ahead of imports for the first time in 6 years, helped by the recent devaluation of sterling, which has also increased the value of earnings from foreign assets, which is positive
   0.00 -1 faces a period of political and economic uncertainty
   0.00  1 Thank you, António, and good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 In terms of the full year, net income is up 5% at GBP 17.5 billion, reflecting both higher NII and other operating income
   0.00  1 And as you've heard, the group delivered an underlying return on tangible equity of 15.6%, up 1.5 percentage points; and a statutory return of 8.9%, up 2.3 percentage points
   0.00  1 Net interest income was GBP 12.3 billion and up 8%, with lower funding and deposit costs, again, more than offsetting asset pricing pressure
   0.00  1 MBNA has contributed GBP 430 million of NII for the 7 months of ownership and is performing ahead of our expectations
   0.00  1 The net interest margin for the year was 286, up 15 basis points
   0.00  1 Other operating income was GBP 6.2 billion and up 2%, with a good contribution from Lex Autolease and Retail, a robust performance in Commercial, offset by reduced Insurance income due mainly to lower bulk annuities
   0.00  1 And excluding the impact of MBNA, operating costs fell 1% year-on-year to GBP 8 billion
  -0.10  0 This is after a large single corporate impairment in the third and fourth quarters, and the consolidation of MBNA in the second half of the year, which adds around 2 basis points to the ratio
   0.00 -1 Our net AQR of 18 basis points reflects the lower expected level of releases and write-backs
   0.00  1 The coverage ratio of 45% is up 4 percentage points, with a prudent increase in coverage across all business lines despite the fall in impaired loan ratios
   0.00  1 Our prime credit card book uses conservative pricing and reserving assumptions, and is performing well
   0.00  1 Lending is also up 3%, including year-on-year growth of around GBP 1 billion in the open mortgage book
   0.08 -1 Underlying profit in Insurance and Wealth is down 3% on 2016 due primarily to lower new business income from bulk annuities and a lower contribution from Wealth
   0.00  1 The business, though, continues to generate strong returns and capital generation, with an underlying ROTE of just over 16% and a full year dividend of almost GBP 700 million
   0.00  1   Finally, in the Center, we've seen increased income on profits due to the GBP 146 million gain on the sale of VocaLink and the GBP 274 million of gains on the sale of liquid treasury assets, primarily the gilts that I mentioned earlier
   0.33  0 Looking then at statutory profit
  -0.05  0 Restructuring costs of GBP 621 million were in line with 2016 and include the final costs of the Simplification program, as well as our investment in our nonbranch property rationalization, the group's ring-fencing program and the integration of MBNA
  -0.15  1 PPI costs of GBP 1.7 billion include GBP 600 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in expected weekly claims through to the time bar from 9,000 to around 11,000, which is the average received over the last 9 months
  -0.08  0 Other conduct and remediation charges were GBP 865 million and included GBP 325 million in the fourth quarter for package bank accounts, arrears handling and other legacy issues
   0.00  1 Going forward, we expect remediation costs to reduce significantly
   0.14  0 Loans and advances stand at GBP 456 billion, up GBP 6 billion in the year and up GBP 11 billion since the low point in Q1
   0.00  1 As guided, the open mortgage book finished the year slightly ahead of 2016
   0.00  1 And as we heard, the SME portfolio continues to grow ahead of the market, while Motor Finance continues to grow strongly and within the group's conservative risk appetite
   0.00 -1 Even after allowing for MBNA, however, RWAs are down GBP 5 billion in the year at GBP 211 billion, reflecting the portfolio optimization, model approvals and ongoing RWA reduction, predominantly in Commercial
   0.00  1 And our CET1 ratio, after the ordinary dividend, was a strong 14.4%
  -0.12  0 We've now agreed the latest actuarial valuation and the new deficit contribution plan
   0.00  1 After adjusting for MBNA, TNAV increased 3.1p per share before dividends, driven by the strong statutory financial performance, offset obviously by a deduction of 3.2p for the dividend payments
   0.00  1 The trajectory of the statutory ROE is clear, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 14% to 15% return on tangible equity in 2019
  -0.20  0 I think we now have 30 minutes for questions on the results
   0.30  0 There'll be plenty of time and plenty of opportunity later to discuss the group's new strategy
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.50  0  So yes, just 2 questions, if I may
  -0.04  0 And yes, I suppose if we look at your cost target, your cost-income ratio target and what you're saying about a resilient margin, it does actually look like we need a quite punchy other income and loan growth expectation to deliver that
  -0.10  0  Okay, so I'll tell you, as I usually do, segment-by-segment, to give you an idea of what our targets and intentions are
  -0.20  0 So in terms of the open mortgage book, our intention is to do exactly the same that we did last year
   0.00  1 And in the mortgage market, given the low growth of the market, historically high house prices, uncertainty in general, we think the right thing to do for our shareholders is to continue to privilege margin and capital and lower risk, so we'll continue to focus on margin
  -0.17  1 But over the plan, to your question, we think there will be growth in the open mortgage book
  -0.08  0 In terms of Consumer Finance in general, so including UPLs, Credit Cards and car finance, our intention is to grow reasonably in line with the market over the next 2 or 3 years
  -0.05  1 SMEs, where we have consistently grown above the markets in the last 6 years and which is a critical area, we think, given the huge importance for employment and exports in the country, we have always focused a lot on SMEs as you know, our expectation is to continue to gain market share in SMEs
   0.00  1 So that is an area we expect to grow and gain market share
   0.11  0 It depends on how companies want to access the market, through capital markets, securitizations, you name it
  -0.50  0 You had a second question?  Yes
   0.06  0 I continue to expect -- on one hand, as you said, I continue to expect TFS ending to have an effect on funding for players in the market in general, especially the ones that took the most of TFS, the smaller players
   0.00 -1 And therefore, that is going to pressure their cost of funds
  -0.50  0 So you have 2 contradictory factors there
   0.00 -1 So it almost doubles and, therefore, to be another pressure for prices to go slightly up
   0.00 -1 But all in all, as I have been saying now for 3 years, I expect the trends to be the same over the next 12 months, so some pressure in mortgage prices, which we will continue to offset given we have higher costs on our multi-brands approaching certain brands
  -0.12  0 But it's a bit of misleading because it depends the extent to which you're invested and liquid
   0.10  0 And the easy way to short-circuit that and show the sensitivity of the business is to look at things like the structural hedge, which we talk about and my GBP 165 billion of invested assets, and say 1% on that, which will come over time, is an easy bit of math to do, and the GBP 1.5 billion, the GBP 1.6 billion
  -0.11  0 And whilst somewhat might limit at the moment, in terms of GBP 165 billion, let's see where balances grow
   0.00  1 And we're very good at growing current account balances, as we have in 2017
   0.00  1 If those continue to grow, those will add to the volumes
   0.00  1 But also, whilst on about that GBP 165 billion in terms of maximum, I'm short, as we've said before, and some are about 3 years versus 4 and a bit, so that gives me ability to extend and play into rate rises as well, so I can deploy that to generate
   0.00  1 Should interest rates be higher, as George very clearly explained, we are very positively exposed to rising interest rates if they rise beyond the plan
  -0.33  0 Second question?  Yes, that was very comprehensive
   0.00  1 On the second one, I mean, what's very clear is there is going to be a significant step-up in cash flows
  -0.08  1 If you generate 200 basis points of capital per year even after paying what dividends you have, there is substantial room, I would argue, to return capital back to shareholders
   0.00  1 It gives us a good platform, helped a lot the corporate pensions
   0.00  1 Our plans are to grow organically
   0.08  0 Should specific opportunities present themselves in areas where we are underrepresented, we'll look at it with the same eyes that we have on the second strategic plan, main target to grow organically
  -0.08  0 And now we have very clear capital requirements post clarification from the PRA in terms of the buffer and in terms of the stress test, which is 13%, plus around 1% management buffer
   1.00  0 Please
  -0.17  0 Perhaps one follow-up on capital and one on your loan-loss guidance
   0.12  0 On the capital, I think you were clear, but just to clarify, the 13% plus 1% is assuming stable Pillar 2A, stable Pillar 2B and embedded in the DSIB and the countercyclical that's coming in
  -0.33  0 Is that correct? You ask a lot
   0.11  0 As we go forward, we think as we continue to derisk the business, then actually, there could be some more opportunity there in that, we'll come to that
  -0.50  0 And then my final question is on loan losses after that
  -0.20  0  And then on the loan-loss point, if you look at your second half loan losses Q3, Q4, 23, 24 basis points
  -0.17  0 There is a small uptick in interest rates, but as I just answered in the previous question, very small
   0.00  1 So we are expecting the base rates to increase from 50 basis points to 125 in 3 years
   0.00 -1 So the 40 basis points through the cycle that had been 60 basis points in our first strategic review, fourth in the second, will now be lower, 35 basis points, so continue to derisk of the bank
   0.00  1 economy, so holistically speaking, what we see is you have these tailwinds that I mentioned to you
   0.00  1 You have exports being positively impacted by the devaluation of the pound given we continue to have complete free trade with Europe
   0.00  1 Earnings from foreign assets are increasing in pounds
   0.00  1 The world growth has increased
   0.00  1 We are a big open economy that helps the U.K
   0.00 -1 economy
  -0.33  0 So for me, it looks quite clear, subject to any major political problem in the world, that the next 12 months will be very much like the past 12 months
  -0.17  0 And we   will have, as businesses, 2 years to plan for that transition, which I think for most businesses is critical
   0.20  0 For us, as you know, it does not impact anything given that we are completely positioned in the British economy
   0.00  1 And therefore, for the next 3 years, our holistic guidance, I think it's very coherent with that assumption
   0.00  1 And given the tailwinds in the U.K
   0.00  1 economy and the world economy, we see a continued resilient economy going forward
   0.33  0 Let's go to this side now, please
   0.14  0 You normally give us a sort of quick rundown as to where it's been, how it's progressing during the year
  -0.17  0 And then the second one was you mentioned you had a -- you've revised your actuarial pension deficit
  -0.14  0 Could you just tell us what that actuarial deficit is now? Yes -- well, I'll start with the pension
   0.00  1 But it was -- previously, it was 5.4, and I think it's gone about 7.2, which it doesn't sound like a good result, but that is a good result, in terms of what's happened to interest rates, et cetera, inflation expectations
  -0.11  0 We also talk about -- it's in the RNS in terms of the deficit contributions, which we've agreed with the trustees
  -0.08  1 On the first bit in terms of the mortgage back book, with the pickup and rates, we've seen a slight pickup in the attrition level
  -0.33  0 It's now around about a 13% attrition rate
  -0.17  0 So it's ticked up to about -- as I say, about 13% in terms of the attrition rate
  -0.25  0 And then I guess my final question, was just on tangible book
   0.00 -1 Your TNAV per share continues to be, well, sort of, I guess, down/flattish, which I guess is the reverse of the rising rate environment and the repricing of your hedging, broadly speaking
   0.00  1 And you will see that -- rates rising is a good thing
   0.00 -1 So that will -- as rates rise up, that will be a headwind
   0.00  1 But I should expect to see in terms of TNAV going forward with that strong stack profit, restatement of the [ bleeding ] obvious, that will drive the TNAV, offset by what we determine in distribution
   0.00 -1 But you're right, in terms of rate rises, you will get a headwind as I reprice that hedge
   0.33 -1 Given the high profitability of MBNA, there was some goodwill
  -0.04  0 Whilst we've talked about the capital, that it's more limited because you get EEL offset and then you've got transitional rules, it'll hit your sort of TNAV from an accounting basis as you step up provisions, as you move into an IFRS 9 world as well
   1.00  0  Please
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions from me
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.50  0  How many questions do you have?  Sorry just the last one
   0.20  0 Just what's the outlook there, please?  Okay, George will take 1 and 3
   0.17  0 I mean, the board will continue to assess the capital at the end of the year with all the available information
   0.09  0 We decided a buyback with the 12-month horizon, so we will continue with the cycle of addressing capital surpluses at the end of the year with all available information then
   0.07  0   And on the Insurance, without being sort of too vague about it, it's a balance between opportunities we see in terms of writing new business, market rates, et cetera
   0.09  0 7 is probably at the sort of top end of what you'd expect, benefits from both, it's the sort of counter to some of the things you see in OOI
   0.11  0 If I'm not putting the capital to work there, then that feeds into the surplus position, we've distributed it
  -0.14  0 And then asking me for the future in terms of what the board might do, I always find those questions a bit tricky
  -0.10  0 So I know it's not a definitive answer to your question, Claire, but I can't answer in terms of what we might do in a future circumstance
  -1.00  0 Any more questions? Douglas
  -0.50  0  Yes, one more question
   1.00  0 So, please
   0.14  0 So if you could give us any more information in relation to how that's evolved since the third quarter, that would be very super helpful
  -0.17  0 I think as we disclosed, the extent to which, if it has to go up again, or 12,000 or whatever, it's about -- for every 1,000 now, it's about GBP 200 million
   0.00  1 The most recent we've seen is slightly above that
  -0.12  0 If you look at the go-forward, the FCA had those -- with the Arnold Schwarzenegger ads or whatever, unfortunately, something's going to follow that
   0.00 -1 We've budgeted for what we've seen or provided for what we've seen, but there are still uncertainties around that
  -0.25  0 And then, unfortunately, a bit like Claire's question, I can't give you hypotheticals
  -0.20  0 We've talked about the earlier question to pensions
  -0.07  0 As I put money into my pension scheme and make those deficit contributions, then, theoretically, your charge in terms of Pillar 2A should go down because you're actually mitigating that risk through contributions
   0.10  0 And I'm afraid what I can't do is tell you that if that happens, what the response of the business would be because it will depend upon the circumstance at that time
   0.00  1 Look, thank you very much
  -0.50  0 We have to stop now for the breakout sessions
  -0.12  0 But any remaining questions, we'll take at the end of the breakout session and the strategy review
  -0.25  0 So you have time to address the remaining questions
   0.00  1 So don't worry, there will be that opportunity
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 This does mark an important inflection point to the group, with the significant change in gear in the transformation of our bank
   0.00 -1 But both António and I have repeatedly said that we could not be complacent
   0.00  1 We've recognized that the environment we face in technology and competition is moving at pace
   0.00  1 So 2 years ago, the board and the executive set out together on a major exercise to create a vision for the bank of the future
  -0.07  1 And as that clarified, we've translated that into an ambitious transformation program to meet that challenge, a transformation program to which the board and the executive team are totally committed
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 We have a number of structural advantages which are difficult to replicate in terms of how we meet customer needs, including our differentiated multi-brand and multichannel propositions, our customer reach as the largest banking franchise in the U.K
   0.00  1 Together, these have seen our customer Net Promoter Scores increase by almost 50% since 2011 to 62%
   0.00  1 We are, by far, the U.K.'s largest digital bank and are able to meet 68% of our customers' banking needs online, which is at the top end of the targeted range we set out 3 years ago
   0.00  1 While we have delivered best-in-class experience to our customers, we need to constantly evolve to meet their changing behaviors and expectations
   0.00  1 They want simpler products with greater convenience and ease
   0.00  1 An example of this is financial planning and retirement, where we will provide our banking and insurance customers with a truly holistic proposition to meet their retirement and long-term savings needs
   0.00  1 We are proud of being the only large U.K
   0.00  1 We continue to be committed to our multichannel model and see branches as another customer-driven resource, where we want to retain the #1 branch network in the U.K
   0.00  1 We will continue to simplify and modernize our IT architecture, scaling up end-to-end customer journey transformation to cover more than 70% of our cost base compared to 12% during GSR2
   0.00  1 Our third strategic priority of maximizing group capabilities will deliver targeted growth, and we expect to see a GBP 6 billion increase in net lending to start-ups, SMEs and Mid Market clients, as you will hear from David in the breakout sessions, and over 1 million additional pension customers and GBP 50 billion of asset growth in our open book financial planning and retirement propositions
   0.40  0 Importantly, the success of our transformation will depend on our people
   0.00  1 In recognition of the evolving skills needs of the U.K, we have trained over 700,000 individuals, businesses and charities in digital skills since last year, and are looking to increase this to 1.8 million by 2020
  -0.08  0 Recognizing the critical importance of start-ups, SMEs and Mid Market businesses to   employment and experts in the U.K
   0.00  1 corporate taxpayer in 2015, and will further increase our total taxes paid in coming years
   0.10  0 financial services provider focused -- completely focused on Helping Britain Prosper
   0.00  1 As António has just outlined, GSR3 constitutes an ambitious transformation for our group
   0.00  1 We have a simple operating model, and we have a centralized management team who have a proven track record in managing transformation
   0.14  0 Last July, we announced changes to our organizational design to prepare us for the successful delivery of GSR3
  -0.12  0 As a result of these changes, we have brought together under one umbrella all the critical components needed to implement the transformation
   0.09  0 This will allow us to adapt to a changing environment and reprioritize if required, depending on customer behavior and market dynamics
   0.10  0 These teams are adopting an Agile approach and focusing on outcomes to be achieved rather than initiatives to be delivered
   0.00  1 As you have heard from António, over the next 3 years, we will deploy more than GBP 3 billion of -- in strategic investments, representing a 40% increase on GSR2
   0.18 -1 Importantly, as we increase our strategic investments, we are not giving up on our ambition to deliver market-leading efficiency
   0.00 -1 Over the GSR3 period, we will bring down our operating cost base to less than GBP 8 billion in 2020
   0.12  0 We would like you to -- we would like to invite you to 3 breakout sessions hosted by the business and transformation leads
  -0.08  0 After a short lunch break, George will then present our financial projections and targets, before António provides some closing thoughts on our strategic plan
  -0.14  0 As you've no doubt realized, we'll be running the 3 breakout sessions concurrently
  -0.25  0 And we're, therefore, now going to break you into 3 separate groups
   0.17  0 If you have a purple lanyard, please make your way over to -- by the white panels in the corner
   0.20  0 And if you have a green lanyard, please make your way to the doors where you came in
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.50  0 [Break] Okay
   0.20  0 I hope you found lunch plentiful and the breakout sessions useful
   0.00  1 economy has been resilient and going forward, while we have prepared for contingencies, our base plan and projections assume this performance continues with a steady increase in base rates to 1.25% by the end of 2020, as I think as I said earlier
   0.00  1 In terms of sustainable growth
   0.00  1 This model is underpinned by our prudent participation choices and the portfolio derisking that we've undertaken over the last few years
   0.11 -1 Our high-quality unsecured portfolio represents just 6% of total loans, and our run-off assets are down by over 95% since 2010 and comprise just 2% of loans and advances
  -0.33  0 And finally, we have very limited exposure to high volatility business lines
   0.00  1 On cost, as you know, we have a strong record for reducing costs and this will continue in the next phase of our strategy
   0.50  0 In terms of profits
   0.00  1 And this capital increase should theoretically reduce our statutory returns by around 90 basis points
   0.00  1 Our simple differentiated business model with its U.K
   0.00  1 We have a clear framework and track record for capital return to shareholders
   0.00  1 GSR3 is a bold and ambitious plan and represents a very significant step-up in our strategic investments over the next 3 years
   0.00  1 We have solid foundations on which we can build: our strong track record and expertise of delivering large and complex change programs; our experience of building the largest digital bank in the U.K
  -0.08  1 and delivering customer journey transformation; and the experience and dedication of our management team, which will allow us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead
  -0.33  0 And we will now take your additional questions
   1.00  0    Please
  -0.33  0 I've got 3 questions
  -0.12  0 I'm sorry to focus on numbers as opposed to the qualitative aspects of the strategy
  -0.06  0 Firstly, I wonder, George, if you could set out for us, for the spreadsheets, the sort of size of the amortization of purchased intangibles, fair value unwind and any additional restructuring that might come below the line over the course of the next year or 2
  -0.20  0 Do you want me to give you the other 2? That sounded like 2 questions
  -0.14  0 I mean, I guess, the -- if I've got one more, I'll ask quite a crude question and it simply relates to where your targets appear to be pointing 2, 3 years out relative to consensus
  -0.08  1 Impairment probably a little bit lower, and you're ending up with an EPS number that's substantially above consensus at the statutory level at the moment
  -0.33  0 And we can also give you on impairment
   0.06  0 For 2018, dealing with the short term, I'd expect there to be about another GBP 0.2 billion, GBP 0.3 billion on ring fencing, probably about another GBP 0.1 billion in terms of property and probably about a GBP 0.1 billion in terms of the MBNA integration spend
  -0.06  0 In terms of -- I haven't looked to what the guidance is for 2020, so I can't sort of comment on what that does for implied revenue-type numbers, but, I mean, I think we've been quite clear in terms of our low 40s
  -0.11  0 I think we've been quite clear that, that is a change of definition which we haven't majored on, but that will include remediation
   0.00 -1 But the reason we've given the sort of hard target as well, which I think is helpful for people and we're below the GBP 8 billion, below the GBP 8 billion for those operating costs and that's operating costs including all the consequences of that investment spend but excluding the remediation, but my low 40s is both those elements
   0.07  0 Look, in terms of how that pans out and back solve it into income numbers, as I say, I don't know what consensus is for '20 so I can't comment on, but that's right for our business and..
   1.00  0 Please, Alvaro?  Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley
  -0.14  0 So I'm not going to give you the precise breakdown of the number, but that is something we've seen over the last few years, and you will see that continue
   0.00  1 Drive down BAU, create the capacity to invest, and you'll see a pickup in things like depreciation charges coming through
   0.14  0 I know it's easy me saying help you to realize, but that is how it works
   0.00  1    And Alvaro, I would like to add a point to what George just said, which is, I mean, as I said in my introductory remarks, this is a critical strategic advantage, which is both strategical and cultural
   0.08  0 To have a culture of austerity in the sense that you don't spend more than what you should is what enables us to release money, to have higher and higher levels of investment over each of the last 3 plans we did
  -0.17  1 And this is a critical strategic advantage and even more critical in a digital world
   1.00  0 Please
   0.33  0 I've got 2, please
   0.11  0 And you're right, I mean, we talk about stat profits sort of doing that and my capital guidance says that, and that is because of that
   0.00  1 As I go forward, I sort of both will be growing my book, RWA growth
  -0.05  0 So in terms of coming to our cost:income ratios, you take that net income line and you take our costs, and so it's a deduction, so it's not excluded, so that's sort of quite important
   0.00 -1 So in terms of the OOI growing, then that's the cost of sale for that particular part of the business, but it's certainly been slightly higher the last couple of years we've had some write-offs in CB
  -0.20  0 So that -- those write-offs are complete?   Yes, that's correct
   0.14  0  Please, can you just give the microphone?  It's Fahed Kunwar from Redburn
  -0.33  0 I just had a question about other operating income
  -0.20  0 And the second question was on return on investments
   0.00  1 For 2017, I think we had said -- I think a target at the start of the year, as I said, if you strip out VocaLink, I think we'd like to be ahead of the prior year
   0.00 -1 As I said, I think it will stay a relatively tough business
   0.00 -1 So I think you'll see insurance profits pause if not decline a bit in terms of OOI in 2018, but thereafter, that new book builds and takes you away and takes you -- and the insurance build that I hope you got from António, this isn't about actually next year or the next 3 years
   0.06  0 This is about building out for the long term, but I think you won't see much of that in 2018, where I think back book will -- as I say, will sort of run off, will exceed the front book build, but thereafter, you will build and it will start -- and it will continue to build, that's the sort of beauty of it
  -0.10  0 So that GBP 3 billion spend, we kind of strip down certainly the first year's spend at a very granular level in terms of how we prioritize it, how we code it, what makes the cut and, obviously, stuff doesn't make the cut
  -0.11  0 And within that, to your question as well within the financial bit, I will look at those that drive cost takeout and those that generate income
   0.00  1 So you have a very controlled, very centralized, very deliberate process that determines where we spend our money, where we think it is to the best endeavors, the best benefit of the group
   0.00  1 But it's done centrally, which again, I know it's always perhaps difficult to convey to people, but it's a massive advantage as you set out on a project like this in having that control over and that decision-making residing at the center
   0.12  0 And that is the right way to allocate investments, in a transparent and in line with the incentives you were trying to say
   0.00  1 So that the best investments, dynamically, gets the most of the resources
   1.00  0 Please
   0.50  0 If I could just ask one, please
  -0.33  0 Yes, that's correct
  -0.12  0 Within that, going back to one of the earlier questions, as I spend the GBP 3 billion, I'm going to be expensing a fair slug of that as I move through that
  -0.12  0 So I'm not going to answer your question, part of it because I'm not sure it sort of takes you anywhere
  -0.06  0 The key point to me is -- and when we thought about this, that I could have sat here and said, as we have done previously and people who asked the questions, "I'm going to deliver this much savings," then you say, "Well, okay, I don't know where you'll land
   0.07  0 To your point, there will be some of that GBP 3 billion that's still on the balance sheet rolling off, et cetera, but we tried to be careful, just more helpful that below the GBP 8 billion gives people a better line of sight
  -0.12  0 And going to Chris's target, I think these are quite punchy targets in terms of where we are at the moment
   1.00  0 Please
  -0.11  0  I think our estimate's directionally driven are a continuation of house price increases outside London and the Southeast and some decline in London
   0.00 -1 If you remember, already 4 years ago, we were the first bank even before the FPC to lower the loan to income ratio, from 5 to 4, because it was the only way available to us of deemphasizing market share in London
   0.00 -1 That has reflected in ourselves having lower new business at high house prices
   0.00  1 The increase in house prices throughout this period has lowered the back book prices, and our LTV had a massive transformation where we have, as I said, above 90% of the book, equal or below an 80% LTV
  -0.08  0 And we've also -- to that resilience, to António's point, from memory, it used to be like a -- we, obviously -- you stress test the hell out of the thing
   0.00 -1 Claire, I think in your comments, you said you think margins will stay resilient
   0.00  1 I mean look, resilient means resilient
   0.00 -1 economy going
  -0.50  0 So Martin -- so Michael, you will believe it or not at your own peril
   0.11  0 Just on -- clearly a lot of today is about open banking and the opportunities that you think that, that brings to the group
   0.17  0 The more they interact with us, the more insights we have on what they want and they are changing quickly what they want
   0.12  0 And as you heard in Vim's session, we have very interesting plans for that, which we will be panning out as we install each of the innovations that we have in our plans
  -0.10  0 It's not a material amount because the company already do things like through-the-cycle RWAs as oppose to point in time
  -0.33  0 So maybe I could ask the question another way then
  -0.09  1 When I hear your LTVs, et cetera, it looks like your mortgage book is very well placed to protecting any downturn, et cetera
  -0.08  0 Is it the old Birmingham Midshires book or have you got some sort of little pockets that are a problem or something more structural? If you look at the appendices, and I have to say that and I hope we've still got the slide in, we do an analysis
  -0.08  0 There's things like the specialist book, which is a legacy book, which is rolling off, and I forget the percentage of [ feign ] that, that causes in the stress but an awful lot comes from that book, which is a legacy book
  -0.25  0 It's going to diminish as we move through time
  -0.11  0 But if you look at the size of that, that specialist book, that's one of those areas that causes a significant amount of our delta in the stress
   0.00  1  Thanks so much
  -0.33  0 Is that going to be renegotiated this year?  JLR, yes
   0.00  1 So you see some of the growth that you've seen on the JLR book and the Motor Finance book has been a function of the fact that, that book is still seasoning, so we saw a growth of about I think 19% last year
   0.33  0 Please, yes?  It's Ian Gordon
   0.00 -1 I think when you were talking earlier about below-the-line items, you said you didn't know what the redundancy costs might be and that can't be true because you know everything
   0.14  0 Or are we talking about redundancy costs, which might flow from the efficiency gains of the plan? It's the latter
   0.10  0 And I really don't know because as we explained in the sort of first of these this morning when we talked to the media, it depends upon what our customers do
   0.00  1 I mean, thank you very much for bearing with us all this time

   0.00  1                                                 Good morning
   0.00  1 Good morning
   0.00  1 As Paul has just outlined, we delivered another strong performance
   0.00  1 We've seen growth across all of our core businesses, all of our core pillars, intellectual property, risk and balance sheet management and capital formation
   0.00  1 The group is truly diversified by business activity, by geography, by currency, providing resiliency across market cycles
   0.00  1 And we have continued to invest in new initiatives and have made selective acquisitions that develop our client offering while meeting our strict financial and strategic criteria
   0.00 -1 LSEG operates in a dynamic global industry and there will continue to be new challenges and opportunities ahead
   0.00 -1 We firmly believe that enhanced regulatory supervision and regulation on a global scale will far outweigh any short-term political benefits of location-based policies, restricting the clearing of euro-denominated transactions to the Eurozone would fragment global markets, increase risk by weakening the default management process and substantially increase cost for investors
   0.00  1 In the bottom right, you'll see that over the course of the year, we have increased our shareholding in LCH, following the sale by certain minority investors
   0.00  1 In Capital Markets for example, shown on the right-hand side of the screen, Turquoise Plato Block Discovery saw a 600% rise in the total value traded over the year
   0.00  1 In Post Trade, clearing volumes increased across the board, and RepoClear launched its new sponsored clearing initiative
   0.00  1 SwapClear remains the leading OTC rates liquidity pool in the world, processing over USD 870 trillion in notional in 2017, driven by significant onboarding of new clients across Europe, across the Americas and Asia Pacific
   0.00  1 And following the SwapClear playbook, take up of these services is at an early stage in the FX pace, but we believe they will continue to gain traction
   0.00  1 CurveGlobal is providing -- is proving to be a highly efficient differentiator, offering genuine choice and liquidity to the market
   0.00  1 The platform has achieved a 300% rise in open interest in the last 12 months and confirmed plans to launch a SONIA futures contract in the second quarter of the year
   0.00  1 In the context of best execution rules under MiFID II, CurveGlobal products continue to be best priced or tied the majority of the time while also offering lower transaction fees, free market data and the ability to trade fractional blocks for increased price granularity
  -0.08  1 The expansion of LCH Spider later this year to include all short and long-term euro and sterling contracts, will also maximize the margin offsets available to our customers
   0.00  1 I won't spend much time on Slide 21, but you can see here that FTSE Russell has continued to perform strongly, delivering more than 30% CAGR revenue growth
   0.00  1 It has also increased the value of ETF assets tracking our indices with over $600 billion now benchmarked
   0.00  1 Indexes are firmly embedded across the investment process, and FTSE Russell has the ability to provide customers with a comprehensive product range and a deep data and analytics offering
   0.11  0 And on Slide 23, we reconfirm our confidence in the financial targets that we set at our Investor Update last June
   0.00  1 And we remain focused on delivering growth in group-adjusted EBITDA operating margin to around 55%, by 2019, while maintaining control of our underlying costs
   0.00  1 In summary, our strategic ambition remains the same, to deliver best-in-class capabilities, and to drive global growth and develop our customer partnership approach
   0.00 -1 First of all, I should just apologize
  -0.14  0 [Operator Instructions] I'm going to start firstly by taking questions here from the floor, and then we'll change quickly to take the questions between the floor and the audio
   0.11  0 You won't need microphones, but if you could, please give your name and your company as you give your questions as well please
   0.00  1 So thank you
   0.22  0 So I wonder if you could just talk through what gives you the confidence to reaffirm that and the transparency you have on those targets for 2019?  Okay
   0.00  1 Good morning
  -1.00  0 Just a few questions for me
  -0.06  0 Just in terms of [Technical Difficulty] if you could just maybe remind us or kind of give us a recap on how we should think about the impacts of the movements in pound on yours earnings, and to the P&L
  -0.07  0 Then lastly, just in terms of what is announced to be able to expect with LCH, and so the additional [indiscernible] if you just give us maybe some comment on the financial implications of that and how that will play out?    Okay
  -0.50  0 Only 4 questions, right
   0.11  0  So well, we did try, I mean, in Paul's comment, we did try to provide some further information as to how you can think about depreciation expense for 2018
  -0.12  0 We don't actually break out a lot of detail in terms of the variable comp
   0.00  1 So as we continue to grow, as evaluation continues to grow, those will also continue to grow
   0.00  1 At the same time, we will be able to realize, and this is in response to the answer -- this is kind of building on the answer to the question I gave Philip, operating expenses will also will be able to get benefits in the OpEx lines from the core OpEx in terms of IT functionality and core staffing
   0.10  0 But in addition to the guidance -- beyond the guidance that I just gave on depreciation -- that we gave on depreciation this morning, there really isn't any more specific color we would provide other than just a general commitment we have and confidence we have in the target being achieved in 2019
   0.00 -1 But also I think we've signaled to you today that the underlying tax rate is lower-than-expected
  -0.33  0 I think our next question was on..
   0.00  1 We've seen sharp increases and a 600% rise
   0.00  1 We're also seeing increases in other businesses
   0.00  1 It is helping customers comply with best execution rules
  -0.14  0  There was a question on FX sensitivities, perhaps I can point you in a couple of areas there
   0.00  1 That has led to an increase in our U.S
  -0.20  0 I think your last question was on the LCH stake
  -0.14  0 This is a governance model that was absolutely intentional when we made the acquisition of LCH in the first place
   0.10  0 It is really a very -- it's just a great example of how we operate in an open access world in partnership with our customers
   0.18  0 The governance framework still remains the same in terms of our position on the board, the position of other minority investors on the boards in various committees
  -0.25  0  Can I go to the questions on the phone line
  -0.12  0 [Operator Instructions] And our question comes from the line of Gurjit Kambo of JP Morgan
  -0.14  0  An apology, if I'm asking questions because I missed obviously the first part of the presentation
  -0.14  0 So the first question is just on sort of Russell revenue and cost synergy targets
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.50  0  Thank you for the question
   0.00  1 So there were certainly some synergies that we were able to take on those acquisitions
   0.50  0 These are 2 different opportunities
   0.17  0 Mergent is really a data business that we're integrating
   0.50  0 So integrating well on those
   0.50  0  Okay, great
  -1.00  0 And then a second question
  -1.00  0 Well, we disclose what we do have
  -0.12  0 So margins can be calculated obviously on that disclosure and that's the extent to, which we disclose them
  -0.33  0 I think there was a -- and the question was, was this for full year '19
  -0.12  0 So exit rate for the EBITDA margins in both cases was I think the question you asked initially
  -0.20  0  Do we have another question on the phone line? Yes sir, our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW
   0.25  0 But -- you guys noted that the CEO search is progressing
  -0.50  0 Thank you for the questions
   0.00  1 Look, the board, there is a well-defined strategy that we have
   0.00  1 We're committed to delivering on that
   0.12  0 Certainly, part of that is an ongoing effort on the part of the entire management team to evaluate opportunities, to evaluate organic investments, and to evaluate inorganic opportunities
  -0.20  0 So that, I would say, is in no way shutdown, it continues to be part of our strategy
   0.14  0 And in that sense, all opportunities for growth and shareholder returns are certainly being looked at
   0.50  0  Okay, great
   0.00  1 So it sounds like and it looks like Turquoise's Plato Block Discovery has done well thus far in the year despite the delays in the double volume caps for dark trading
   0.07  0 I think, you, in the past have said the updated yield here is about 6x greater than that of the normal LIT book, but just wanted to get your thoughts there?  Let me take the first part of it
   0.00  1 Look, it's performing well
   0.00  1 So we're quite pleased with it
  -0.33  0    Matt, your question on the yield
  -0.25  0 I think we got a question from the floor
  -1.00  0 3 quick questions, if I may
  -0.12  0 Firstly, can I just check I've understood the 2 disposals you did of Exactpro and Millennium ESP
   0.00  1 So the disposal of those should boost your EBITDA margins a little bit, just check the logic for that
   0.00  1 Settlements is an area -- that is an area that's rich in terms of its future, in terms of its prospects, there will be continuing demand for good global collateral management from global customers
   0.14  0 So in terms of what we're doing about it, again it's broadly in the context of looking at all opportunities out there
   0.40  0 But there are a range of different opportunities that are out there to enhance our existing businesses
  -0.50  0 What is the first one?  First one is on the 2 disposals
   0.00  1 So obviously, we got up to 43%
  -0.07  0 So our long-term intention in terms of ownership, we would never really speculate -- we never give specifics on, but I think as additional investors come in, we could anticipate selling some of that -- some of that ownership down
  -1.00  0 Question from Johannes
  -1.00  0 3 questions, if I may
  -0.13  0 And last, but not least here, we all know that politicians don't tend to have rational economic decisions, but regulators are forced to move the Eurozone banks to move their clearing to the Eurozone probably
  -0.06  0 And there has been a comment from Futures Industry Association doubting the interest rate swap clearing capability of LCH SA, if you could comment on that as well?  Yes, okay
   0.00  1 The growth that we're seeing in Turquoise is on the block side
  -0.50  0 We just don't break it out that way
   0.00  1 I think we run that business holistically with strong customer relationships
   0.00  1  If market cap levels would fall like 10% a year, you would still believe in double-digit volume growth -- revenue growth?  I think -- obviously that's not happened yet, we do sensitivities
   0.00  1 That's a business that's had some strong growth
  -0.08  0 And that's a business that as you know, is quite sticky because you know this data once you have it, it's hard to move with that -- it's hard to keep going without it
   0.00  1 And I think we have always felt that that's one of the strengths of the businesses, is the diversity of actually how we interact with our customers and how we sell our products
   0.20  0 We're not in a position to predict outcomes at this time
   0.10  0 I think we're really about being prepared to react in whichever way it goes, at the same time our position hasn't changed
   0.00  1 Again, a general -- my general answer is, LCH SA obviously is performing well
  -0.29  0 So any more questions on the audio line before we conclude? There are no further questions from the telephone
   0.50  0 Please continue
   0.00  1 Thank you, again, for everyone for turning up, and thank you on the phone lines for bearing with us
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1 Thank you

---FILE: NEXT plc.txt

   0.00  1 In that vein, I would really like to thank all the 40,000-plus employees of NEXT for their hard work and commitment, which really comes through in the financial results
   0.00  1 Michael has made a huge contribution to the group and a huge contribution to the board
   0.00  1 Michael has been very effective in handling issues in the area of warehousing and logistics, some of the most complicated issues that NEXT faces
  -0.20  0 And one of the things that you'll see today that comes through in the presentation is that NEXT has not stopped in looking at all the problems, but really is focusing on a number of new initiatives to try to face this new and challenging market
   0.00  1 I believe that the leadership team of NEXT is very strong and is going to execute the correct measures to really build shareholder value in the future
   0.00 -1 Top line -- total sales down 0.5%, full price sales up 0.7%
   0.25 -1 This is all about the fact that we were less effective at clearing our sales stock last year than we have been in the past
   0.50 -1 Operating profit, down 8.2%
   0.00 -1 So -- and this is a story that, throughout the presentation, we're going to try and sort of elucidate exactly why that was, why it -- how is it that the top -- a stable top line turns into a negative bottom line
   0.33  0 Interest benefit of GBP 4 million here
   0.50 -1 And profit after tax down 6.8%
   0.00  1 Dividend maintained despite declining earnings per share, but still very healthily covered at 2.6x
   0.00 -1 There is only one reason for this really, and that is that the amount of money we spent on the stores reduced significantly
  -0.14  0 Around GBP 12 million of that reduction was stores that we aimed to open last year that were delayed and opened in this year
   0.04  0 But I think, generally, the amount we're going to spend on new stores over the next 4 or 5 years will obviously be   tempered as we raise the bar in terms of being sure that those stores not only make a profit on the first day, but they'll make a profit at the -- on the last day at the end of their lease as well
   0.00  1 This is sort of people just come from university graduates, so we have set some accommodations up where they can come and live for 6 months in a sort of safe and very nice environment in order to find their housemates move on
  -0.09  0 The other issue -- the other item, big-ticket item is GBP 4 million on new RFID handheld terminals in our stores
   0.00 -1 Warehouse, much less than last year
   0.17  0 A little bit more space opening, again, boosted by the space that moved from this year into next year
   0.00 -1 As we ran into Christmas, we ran up against the capacity constraints of our Directory warehouse or online warehouse
   0.00  1 We were able to cope with that operationally in terms of our service to our customers
   0.00 -1 What's interesting about -- if you look at the total stock holding online, we don't anticipate that, that will grow enormously
   0.12  0 And as we take advantage of the opportunity that online gives us to have smaller buys so we're -- and the addition of additional -- the addition of those extra item options means that you need more forward location
  -0.11  0 You'll notice also throughout this presentation, I'll refer intermittently to Directory as online and Directory
   0.00 -1 Big swing in working capital
   0.00 -1 Cash flow before distribution to shareholders, down 47% -- GBP 47 million
   0.00 -1 And it's just worth stressing that the reduction in cash flow is less than the reduction in profits
   0.00  1 And I just want to reassure you that the quality of our earnings, in terms of our provisioning, is as robust as it has ever been
   0.00  1 This -- the distribution to shareholders was larger than the cash generation, and that was as a result of us bringing forward this year's buybacks into January
   0.00  1 Still robust
   0.00  1 Stock, up 8.6% at the year end
   0.00  1 This isn't because we expect our sales to be up by 8%
   0.17  0 If you split it out into the 2 halves, you'll see that, in the first half, Directory debt was broadly stable on credit sales that were broadly stable
   0.00  1 In terms of our funding, still very well financed against our peak debt requirements, GBP 1.2 billion of peak debt versus GBP 1.4 billion of bonds and bank facilities
   0.04  0 I think it is very important to make sure that our retail accounts accurately reflect and the store-by-store profitability accurately reflects the actual profit the retail is making because if we don't, we could end up shutting shops that are actually making us money
  -0.11  0 All the numbers you'll see in the Directory and retail accounts that I'm about to go through have been restated to account for that GBP 14 million swing in both this year and last year
   0.00 -1 Full price sales, down 7%
  -0.14  0 I think store closures are going to become an increasing part of the retail landscape
   0.00 -1 On the face of it, it looks like we're being too aggressive because the stores are making 12%
  -0.12  0 In reality, one of the stores we shut was a compulsory purchase of our shop in Eastbourne for redevelopment
   0.12  0 And there are 2 things we look at when we decided whether to close the store: one is the profitability and the other is the actual quantity of cash profit that it's making because there is a cost in servicing a shop as well, getting the area manager there, display team
   0.20  0 Equally, we would never sign a new lease for a store that is only making 10% profit
  -0.08  0 When we can't reach an agreement with the landlord for a new lease but -- we just carry on paying the old rent until such time that one or other of us wants to shut the operation, the landlord or ourselves
   0.00 -1 Missed its target slightly, which isn't a surprise or shouldn't be a surprise given the performance of our ranges in the first half
   0.20  0 What we're now doing is when we appraise a new store, we are looking at what the -- not just what the profit will be day 1
   0.11  0 In the good old days, you'd say, it doesn't -- we look at the profit in day 1, and then it might go up as time goes on
  -0.20  0 Now I'm afraid we have to take the opposite view
  -0.06  0 So every new appraisal we're doing, we're saying, what is -- what will the profit of this store look like if the worst comes to the worst and there is minus 10% like-for-likes until the end of the lease
   0.08  0 And then we look at the internal rate of return on the capital invested over that term and what the year ex profit is when the lease term ends
   0.17 -1 In terms of profit analysis, a big drop in profits
   0.00 -1 We actually put significantly less stock into the end-of-season sale than last year, 9% less stock but sales were down 16%
   0.00 -1 Generally, sort of the chat in our industry is that markdown has become less effective
   0.09  0 So people have always got access to the last season sale in the sort of clearance, in effect, the online clearance store that is a tab in most people's websites
  -0.25  0 And that'll be a sort of rational reason
  -0.20  0 Stock loss actually as a cash figure remained broadly the same
   0.00 -1 The amount of stock taken from our stores has remained the same but obviously, the store sales went down
  -0.20  1 So markdown costs, as a percentage of sales, went up marginally
   0.00  1 Store occupancy costs went up as a percentage of sales
   0.00 -1 That's all about falling sales
  -0.06  0 Again, this is the deleveraging of fixed overheads in our warehouse in the distribution operation where, I think, we probably haven't moved fast enough to cut back on some of the costs that are semi-fixed, and I'm going to come on to that later
   0.00  1 Sales up 9%, 11% full price
   0.00  1 You can see that our LABEL stock, the third-party brands we sell through NEXT Directory was much, much bigger growth
  -0.25  0 That isn't quite the whole picture
   0.00 -1 And you can see in the first half, the NEXT branded stock was significantly down in the previous year
   0.00  1 And in the second half, it was up
   0.00  1 We think we will grow NEXT branded stock online in the year ahead and by more than 2%
   0.00  1 26% growth in sales
   0.50  0 Sounds brilliant
   0.33  0 It's not as brilliant as it sounds
   0.00  1 So you can see that credit customers last year increased sales by 9% on flat numbers of customers
   0.00 -1 Jan 2016, there were 5% -- nearly 6% down on the previous year
   0.00 -1 And we think that at the very worst, we will stabilize the credit customer numbers now
   0.25  0 In terms of profitability and margin and assets
  -1.00  0 Markdown
   0.12  0 The same effect in Directory that we had in retail, where the increase in sales stock wasn't matched by an increase in sales
   0.00 -1 Although interest income grew, it didn't grow as fast as sales so that reduces margin
  -0.11  0 We've done a lot to reduce unnecessary spend on catalogs and mailshots
   0.14  0 And really, I think it's worth just going through all the pressures that we felt last year and what they -- what we think will be their effect in the year ahead
   0.00 -1 So cost price inflation was a big issue for us
   0.00 -1 So -- and I think the point there is that actually, we don't feel that the raising of our prices left us in a significantly worse competitive position than we were in at the beginning of the year
   0.20  0 And we're comfortable with our competitive position about prices at the moment
   0.00 -1 So I think you can sort of characterize these headwinds into 2 types: cyclical which, at some point, they will work their way through the economy; and structural, where actually it is a profound change to the nature of our industry and we need to work out how the company is going to cope with this change going forward
   0.17  0 And it's just worth talking about the profitability of the different income streams
   0.17 -1 This is the 8.2% decline in group profit compared to stable headline
   0.00  1 So you see, overall, our sales went up by 26%
   0.00 -1 If you look, and there's a little bit of fiction here, but bear with me because it explains the nature of the profit erosion that we're seeing at the moment
   0.20  0 That's not because Directory makes less profit than retail
   0.17  0 Actually, it makes more profit than retail at a net level
   0.00  1 We overachieved in Directory
  -0.12  1 We gained more sales in Directory than we lost in retail, so that sort of reduces the structural cost around GBP 6 million
  -0.25  0 So in your mind, so you can see there are 2 different losses going on here
  -0.12  0 These are the costs -- the changes in our fixed cost base, the ones that don't directly relate to growth or decline in sales
   0.00 -1 And the big issue here has been the step- change in Directory cost base
   0.09  0 The GBP 11 million we invested in revenue costs to build new systems and marketing capabilities, which was more than paid off but which cost us profit last year
   0.12 -1 And so what you have there in that 1 graph is an explanation as to how top line sales of roughly flat delivered profits down 8%
   0.11  0 So in terms of the year ahead, and we've changed the graphic here, to give you not a beautiful sunny day but perhaps to give you an end of the storm in sight
   0.00 -1 In terms of the cyclical pressures, some of them are definitely reducing
   0.00  1 If you look at Bank of England's central forecast for inflation and their central forecast for average earnings, they anticipate that we will see a return to real income growth in the middle of the year
   0.14  0 So it looks we're now in a position where already averaging comes moving forward
   0.00 -1 A caveat there, it will take, in my view, at least 6 months for that to really hit the consumers' consciousness
   0.14 -1 It will take a while for it   to work back, but there's a reason to be slightly optimistic on that
   0.00 -1 So cyclical pressures, moving back
  -0.12  1 Product remains at the heart of our business, and you can see the power of getting it wrong from our figures last year in the first half
  -0.11  0 But just to give you a sense of what went wrong, this was the 6th page of our tailoring section in the February brochure that we issued last year
  -0.20  0 It's called New Romance and it should have been called Bad Romance, clearly
  -0.50  0 Defending retail sales
  -0.25  0 We're not just sitting back and doing nothing and waiting for shops to shut
  -0.20  0 And 20% of the items that they're looking for are on a delay
   0.06  0 This is be -- either we're expecting returns back from customers, so we've sold -- in effect, we've sold and anticipated return or more often, it's because we're anticipating a delivery or a predelivery from a supplier
  -0.14  0 40% of the items on the delay are in a store that is close to -- local to the average customer
   0.20  0 We started to fund that opportunity just for Christmas with a Find In Store button
  -0.09  0 It will tell the customer if it was there this morning, but it won't tell them if -- it's almost impossible for us to find it and put it aside at the moment
   0.25  0 And the systems calendar is always 1 or 2 months in advance of the actual
   0.00  1 We think that 17% of the stock can be done that way, so it's very cheap
   0.14  0 They'll, in effect, be able to open a retail account rather than a Directory account
   0.00  1 It won't be enormous but what we do know is that the customers -- when we give Directory customers the access to their Directory account in stores, we know that their sales go up by more than 10%
  -0.14  0 And the question I have been asked for the last -- about 7 years is surely there's nothing left in the tank to save now
  -0.21  0 And what I want to stress is that the cost savings that we made in the business and are making in the business are not sort of red pens, people sitting down and saying cut that out, cut that out
   0.00  1 So the -- all the savings that we're making are driven either by technology, rightsizing our Directory business, better negotiation, and making sure that expenditure in the past that was relevant, we are cutting out now that it is no longer relevant
   0.00  1 One of those projects is a GBP 2 million saving in scanning costs
  -0.05  0 At the moment, we scan every single item on our shop floor every week to ensure that we've got the correct balance between stockroom and the shop floor and stock it in the stockroom, make sure there aren't any sizes missing in the stockroom
   0.00 -1 So we're not doing that
   0.00  1 We will be able to scan at least   5,100 items an hour, and that will give us a saving of GBP 2 million
   0.00  1 I think it should be much higher than that
   0.00 -1 And you can see that we just haven't anticipated aggressively enough the reduction in retail sales
   0.00  1 This is interesting
   0.08  0 Obviously, you don't get rent reduction at review, but at the end of the lease you've got an opportunity to renew
   0.07  0 You shouldn't count that GBP 5 million capital contribution as a profit to NEXT because we spend more than all of it, making sure that those stores are fit for purpose for the balance of the lease
   0.00  1 So we're not -- we are reinvesting that money in the stores, but the 25% reduction in rent is a real cost saving
   0.09  0 In addition, where we are refitting the stores and using that capital contribution, we'll take the opportunity of putting concessions in
   0.00 -1 And so we've got -- we've generated around another GBP 170,000 worth of revenue from new concessions, which takes the -- if you got the net rent, down by 28% in those shops
   0.00 -1 It takes the rent, as a percentage of sales, down to 7.5%
  -0.17  0 Of the 29 that we think we can and will renegotiate, and these are estimated numbers, we think that we can take the rent down by around 22%
   0.10  0 Every appraisal we look at, we are looking at what the profitability will be at the end of a lease, assuming minus 10% like-for-likes
   0.12  0 And the average lease length we expect on these stores will be around 5 years, same level of profitability around 21%
   0.11  0 Because some of them will open halfway through the year, we won't necessarily get the full amount of the benefit in this current year
   0.00 -1 We -- happily, we put that criticism to bed
   0.12  0 We've got a car -- a very small innovative car showroom and a new and extended café
   0.33  0 So -- I mean, the IRR is acceptable but not brilliant
   0.17  0 But we don't anticipate they're going to be a huge source of profit
   0.25  0 We only get half the profit anyway
  -0.11  0 So we're constantly testing the free catalogs to see which customer segments respond, which don't, and where we can cut them back
   0.00  1 What's interesting about photography is that photography has become, I think, much more accessible but that makes it cheaper
   0.20  0 If you look at photography sort of 5, 10 years ago, it was all very perfect
   0.00  1 It's all much faster, quicker
  -0.08  1 In changing the style of our photography, we have saved a lot of money taking those photographs as well without, we believe, in anyway reducing the quality as far as the customer is concerned of the photographs
   0.00  1 And we think -- what we saw is an acceleration of growth in both retail and online
   0.00  1 I say acceleration of growth
   0.50  0 Please don't do that
   0.14  0 We're not intending that -- that line really shows a step-change rather than a progression
   0.09  0 You can see nextpay, a much more effective mobile site; NextUnlimited, where customers can sort of pay for all they eat with GBP 20 for free delivery for the rest of the year
   0.33  0 And we think that there is a cumulative effect here
   0.00  1 In fact, we've got more to do than we can program
   0.07  0 But in essence, we now have -- we've spent a lot of money last year developing a data marketing platform that combines all of the information that we know about our customers, including their recent browsing history, purchase history, average spend, where they live, demographic, all the rest of it with the information that we can get from Google when those people are searching and recognizable when they're going around the Internet
   0.25  0 So just to sort of explain the effect of this, this is a real case study
  -0.25  0 Here is a fictitious site, where we would bid for customers in that manner
  -0.17  0 And as a result of that, what you can see is that you end up getting slightly worse mix of customers because you're paying the same for actually the best customers as the worst customers
   0.00 -1 Your best customers are reduced from 10 to 7 that you see, and the low customers increase
   0.00  1 And customers also have flexibility that if they don't want to pay off the full amount at any point, they can pay off the minimum payment
   0.00  1 And if they pay all of on time, has no cost to them, will drive additional sales and drive interest in an account in a customer group that simply isn't interested in an all-star mail order account
   0.00 -1 It also means that we can't deliver to store
   0.00  1 So at very little cost, we can pick up their stock, and inject it into our network, which means we can send it directly to the customer which should reduce costs, possibly consolidate that stock with other similar stock or with their own held orders
   0.00  1 And going forward, we think that will become more and more important
  -0.05  0 However, I don't think that we have lost our reason and that we haven't lost sight of the dark side, which we're fond of anyway because as effective as those stores may be as a distribution point for Directory stock and as distributed warehousing, they're very expensive
   0.20 -1 So that pessimistic scenario looks now slightly optimistic, and it was only for 10 years
   0.00 -1 That profitable stores -- and the profitable stores are held over until such time as they become unprofitable, if they're anywhere near the negative level
   0.00  1 Take it forward another 5 years, and you get sort of a good news and bad news effect
   0.00 -1 What that says to us is that whilst this, we think, is worst-case scenario, it doesn't account for a number of other profit revenue streams
   0.17  0 Those are actually -- although they're Directory profit, they are generated by the stores
   0.07  0 If you assume that in the stores that were new, we are able to get a 15% reduction in rent, which is 10% less than we're achieving at the moment, and in this scenario of minus 10% like-for-like for 15 years, we think that, that is a conservative assumption
  -0.11  0 And most importantly, if you see any transfers of sales, if you look at the stores which are close to other stores and assume that where we shut them, we transfer our 15% to the retail sales
  -0.08  0 In the year coming, we're adding GBP 5 million of concession income, and it doesn't assume any gain from other retailers who are shutting shops
  -0.06  0 It's not what we expect to happen but realistically, we think even in a minus 10% like-for-like scenario, we will generate around GBP 430 million of cash from the stores, be left with a negligible cost at the end of it
   0.00  1 So we think that's a very conservative element
  -0.25  0 But it does not, in any way, detract from the value of our online business
   0.00  1 This is the good bit
  -0.08  0 Looking at next year's forecasts, this is taking central guidance and making ridiculously accurate forecasts, the numbers we can't possibly know
  -0.33  0 So don't panic if one number is higher and the other one is lower
   0.00  1 The best number is probably the 1% growth in group sales
   0.00 -1 In terms of what happens to profit, we would lose GBP 76 million of margin less variable cost saved in retail
  -0.14  0 And in fact, we think, we'll take more online than we lose in-stores
  -0.29  0 We think that the cost of lost -- of margin erosion will be around GBP 23 million in the year ahead
   0.00  1 Cost savings
  -0.08  0 I should stress, we're not -- that step-change will remain, so we're not spending any less on Directory but we're not having another GBP 11 million increase in expenditure
   0.00 -1 That may -- of all the things we're forecasting, that may prove to be the most optimistic because it may just be that sales actually are going out of fashion and that we still -- we see a continued loss of clearance sales
  -0.09  1 And whilst that is a long way off the best performances that NEXT has delivered over the years, we think in the current environment, with the challenges that we faced, that will be a reasonable result for the group

   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.00  1 Thanks for joining us
   0.09  0 In terms of the financial headlines, revenues, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share, all, as we indicated, they would be in our January trading update
   0.00  1 Three new points to note today are: operating cash flow of GBP 669 million with a very healthy conversion rate of 116%
   0.20  0 Operating profits are at the top end of the guidance range
   0.00  1 We're performing well in markets that have played out much as we expected, and that strong balance sheet is enabling us to invest in our digital transformation and return excess capital to shareholders
   0.25  0 With that deal done, we'll then be happy with the Pearson portfolio
   0.00  1 And in the remaining 70% of Pearson, we expect to grow revenues this year
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.12  0 Revenue, operating profit and EPS are all at the upper end of the pre-close view that we shared with you in January
   0.00  1 Cash conversion was 116%, driven by tight working capital management, lower returns and good cash Penguin Random House dividends, offsetting continued investment in product and CapEx
  -0.09  1 The performance of our OPM and virtual school businesses partly offset these declines, with both delivering revenue increases of around 3%
  -0.11  1 This was driven by good enrollment growth across their portfolio partnerships, partially offset by contract exists
  -0.08  1 Professional certification was flat in North America as a result of the phasing of new contract, but we'll benefit in 2018 from the ramp-up of our new contract to administer the U.S
   0.00  1 Revenues more than doubled in the Pearson Test of English, and we saw good growth in OPM
   0.00 -1 In growth, underlying sales were also flat
   0.00  1 We saw increases in a number of key areas: Firstly, South Africa grew 7%, driven by a recovery in spending on school textbooks in some provinces; two, China grew in both English courseware and in Wall Street English, the latter driven mainly by new center openings; and three, we also saw higher sales in the Pearson Test of English, in both India and China
   0.50  0 Turning now to profits
   0.00 -1 In North America, underlying profits reduced 10% driven by sales declines and investment in OPM, partly offset by restructuring benefits from the 2016 reorganization
   0.25  0 This slide shows the profit bridge we gave you in January
  -0.25  0 As I said then, the impact of disposals, challenging trading, other operational factors in inflation, were partially offset by restructuring savings
   0.00 -1 Other operational factors in staff incentive was lower than the combined GBP 115 million that we guided to at the beginning of the year, reflecting slightly higher incentive payments, as a result of a good performance against plan, more than offset by tight cost control
   0.08  0 We define product contribution as the profit made by each product's area before the allocation of geography and centrally-managed costs
   0.14  0 That means this is showing the share of profits after directly attributable product and salary costs
   0.20  0 It's the way that we measure and manage profitability within our businesses
   0.00 -1 But the analysis does show there are 2 notable businesses which have lower than average contribution: Firstly, our OPM business is low margin in the short term because we're investing in ramping up programs ahead of the shared tuition   revenue that comes with enrollment growth
   0.00 -1 Both pressures were worsening the short term, putting profitability under further pressure
   0.00  1 Amongst the businesses that share higher than average contribution, other ones you'd expect, Core student assessment, U.S
   0.14  0 The key point here though, is that there is no overdependence on one particular business in terms of profitability
   0.00 -1 Our tax rate of 11.1% was lower than expected
   0.00 -1 EPS was 54.1p, down on 2016 in headline terms, but above our revised guidance given in October
   0.11  0 Moving on to our 2018 guidance, this slide summarizes the profit and EPS guidance that we gave you in January
   0.20  0 This slide shows the operating profit bridge from 2017 to our 2018 guidance range
  -0.12  0 The base for 2017 is GBP 510 million, adjusting for foreign exchange and the incremental impact of the 2017 disposals
   0.00  1 This incorporates the ongoing challenges in our higher education courseware business, but also an expectation of improved performance in the remaining 70% of Pearson that John referenced in his introduction
   0.07 -1 Other operational factors and incentives reduced profit by GBP 30 million with increased investment in strategic growth areas, mildly offset by lower incentives
  -0.14  1 The restructuring program that we started last year will generate an additional GBP 80 million of savings in 2018
  -0.10  0 You should note that this bridge includes the contribution of all Wall Street English in Utah, which remain in the portfolio at the start of the year and K-12 courseware, which is now held-for-sale, but for which no disposal has been announced
   0.17  0 The combined contribution of those businesses to 2018 operating profit will be around GBP 19 million
  -0.09  0 You can see that our underlying assumptions for the market are largely unchanged, although, we do see a slightly lower drag from enrollment of 2% and from OER of 1.5%, based on our experience in 2017
   0.00  1 This means that we expect underlying declines in market demand of around 6% in 2018, a little better than the 6% to 7% we've previously guided to
   0.29  0   We don't have perfect visibility into this area at this stage of the year, so we've given a range for this benefit of between 1% and 6%
   0.00  1 We're expecting growth in the remaining 70% of our business
   0.06  0 We're on track to deliver the full GBP 300 million of savings in 2020, though obviously, the precise impact will depend on how exchange rates play out over the life of the program
   0.00  1 Cash conversion was 116%, driven by tight working capital management, lower returns and good Penguin Random House cash dividends, offsetting continued investment in product and CapEx
   0.00 -1 For 2018, we'd expect our cash conversion to fall from the exceptional level we saw in 2017, as collections and dividends receivable from Penguin Random House both normalize
   0.08  0 Product development spend will be similar to 2017, but our capital expenditure will fall slightly, as we continue to make progress in our system simplification program
  -0.10  0 At the start of 2018, we still have GBP 150 million to spend on the GBP 300 million share buyback we announced in October, and we will also have cash outflows relating to our restructuring during the year
  -0.11  0 Putting all of this together, we expect net debt to be broadly level with 2017, before the impact of any further disposals or FX
  -0.12  1 You should also note the deferred revenue grew 5% in underlying terms, rising to just over 19% of revenue
  -0.12  0 However, 2 businesses, Wall Street English and K-12 courseware, together account for more than half of our balance sheet deferred revenue
  -0.17  0 Excluding those 2 businesses from the portfolio, the deferred revenue balance would have been around 9%
   0.00  1 Over the past year, we proactively used cash and Penguin Random House disposal proceeds to reduce our debt maturities and substantially eliminate financing risk
   0.00  1 We now have no maturities until 2021, and we've reduced the size of each debt maturity to decrease refinancing risk
   0.07  0 We're now at the point where we   think it'll be helpful to unpack this metric, so that we can all track our digital progression more clearly as you can now see on the right-hand side of the slide
   0.11  0 27% came from digital enable products and services that combine the digital and physical world
  -0.17  1 Just to stress, these nondigital products are still very important to many of our customers and they have real value
   0.14  0 They will continue to be an important part of the revenue and profit mix for Pearson for some time, and perhaps, forever
   0.18  0 But as we make good progress on our strategy, the weight of our sales will shift steadily to the digital and digital-enable categories
   0.11  0 So let's take a look at how these priorities play out in the businesses that now make up nearly 80% of our revenues, and profits, as you've just seen from Coram's profit contribution analysis
   0.14  0 higher education courseware accounts as you heard from Coram, were just under 30% of our revenues and our profits
   0.00  1 And we're expecting that to increase to 75% beyond 2020
   0.13  0 But a winning sustainable strategy needs to recognize that the specific needs of all 3 customer groups needs to be met, students, faculty and college leadership
   0.00  1 And you can see from last year's results that those plans are gaining traction
   0.00  1 Our digital rental model is now the most affordable option for students, is priced more competitively than print rental
  -0.14  0 But we're doing it carefully, respecting the concerns of faculty and authors and working with them as we do so
   0.00  1 Because that's the best way to get traction longer term
   0.00  1 What you're hearing though is that we're going to focus on a coherent and consistent way of meeting the needs of students, of faculty and of administrators for affordability, yes
   0.00  1 Now offer offering learners more affordable choices, as you've heard me say, helps us to grow because it expands our addressable market
  -0.20  0 I'm going to keep my commentary quite high level
  -0.10  0 And we've seen some shift in contracts in some of the early adopters in service, some services or insource some services, or try to go it alone
   0.00  1 We're learning from that, and we're learning that we need to adopt our own offerings, which were some of the first to market more quickly to meet the changing needs of our partners and that's what we're doing
  -0.11  1 The first year of our new American medical colleges contract is the latest in a long series of big wins, the Pearson View, 50 new contracts signed last year
  -0.12  1 And that extensive network of centers that supports those contracts is also the platform that has powered the exceptional growth of the Pearson Test of English
   0.00  1 Pearson Test of English is more convenient than its rivals
   0.00  1 It provides much more personalized feedback, and is actually also a more accurate assessment of ability of all 4 skills for those relying on the results of the test
   0.00  1 So those are the primary ways in which Pearson will grow over the next few years
   0.00  1 And so with that, Coram, the executive team and I will be very happy to take your questions
   0.06  0 To help answer your questions, we have here, Tim Bozik, who leads on Global products; Rod Bristow, who leads in our Core geographies; Kevin Capitani, for North America; Gio Giovannelli for our Growth Markets; and Albert Hitchcock, for Technology and Operations
   0.14  0 Bob Whelan, who leads our North American Assessment businesses can't be with us today because he is at a major customer event
   0.12  0 But we also have with us completing the executive team, Kate James, who leads our Marketing And corporate Affairs; Jonathan Chocqueel-Mangan, who has joined us to lead on Strategy; Anna Vikström Persson, who has joined to lead on Human Resources; and Bjarne Tellmann, our General Counsel
   0.00  1 And if we just look at the numbers, I mean, in 2016, and clearly, enrollment growth of 19%, I think, in a double-digit revenue growth
   0.00  1 And I appreciate that you are the market leader in the segment
  -0.17  0 So we're then also the first to have to deal with big waves of contracts as they come up for renewal after that 7 to 10 years
   0.00  1 In a business context what you have to do is have a very strong pipeline, and we do, 3x sometimes and 5x now, to use that terminology to combat that
   0.00  1 And basically you need to stay ahead of that, and we're well ahead in terms of pipeline, both in our Core and our graduate market
   0.00  1 So we're planning for that really, really well
  -0.10  1 I think that some of the contracts and the renewals that we're going through, not only is it strong, in terms of getting all those renewals, but in terms of expansion that we're going towards
   0.00  1 So we're really bullish on this
   0.09  0 The thing that Coram mentioned is important, in the investment when you start new programs, you have a 2-year to 3-year ramp to get that profitability or get that contribution
   0.00  1 And we're in that cycle right now with a strong pipeline
   0.00  1 So really, really strong on our pipeline
   0.00  1 If you look at the undergraduate market and the enterprise what we're calling market, with Maryville and ASU, that's a growing market
   0.00  1 You're going to see an uptick and additional programs enter ASU
   0.08  0 We actually have some courseware synergy that we can take advantage of there versus the graduate market, which is kind of a bespoked lecture oriented without the courseware
  -0.18  0 So on the first question, just to confirm, there is no interconnectness between the GBP 300 million of savings relating to our simplification program and the K-12 disposal
  -0.13  0 I think it's a little premature to start speculating about what excess capital there might be and therefore what we might do with it, given that we haven't close the transaction in Wall Street English, and we've only announced today that we're in a process for K-12
  -0.11  0 But I think the board has demonstrated an appetite to return excess capital, if its' there, but we can't speculate just yet just to whether or not if we'll be there
   0.09  0  And just to sort of manage expectations, unlikely processes remind everybody what the profit contribution from that K-12 business is
  -1.00  0  Good question, John
   0.10  0 I just -- I mentioned in my presentation that it's GBP 19 million relating to K-12 and Wall Street English, of that GBP 11 million of profitability in 2018 related to K-12
  -0.20  0 So I think you have to think about that number when thinking about proceeds from the disposal
   0.07  0 And then, Tim, do you want to give a flavor of where we think we are from a cost enrollment perspective and also the confidence we have in where we think the impact of OER will be as Coram called it on the chart?  Right
  -0.20  0 From an OER perspective as well, I think we're quite close to the OER environment, because we're quite close to our customers
   0.00  1 But they also place very high value on outcomes and choices
  -0.25  0 And for our British audience, just to remind you, that was an American use of quite
  -1.00  0 Next question here from Chris
  -0.14  0 Just a follow-up on Coram's very good question about the contribution from K-12
  -0.17  0 Coram, do you want to pick up on the first of those questions?  Sure
   0.00 -1 But the GBP 11 million is the right number to focus on, because that is the profit that we will lose as a result of the business leaving the portfolio
   0.00  1 On the -- on MyLabs and registrations, I mean, as you can see, last year has played out as much as we called it, about 18 months ago, which we're seeing good growth in digital revenues as we add new features and functionality to the MyLab and mastering products, but they are at the top of the S curve from a maturity point of view
   0.12  0 So growth in registrations is very dependent on the pipeline of new products and features coming through
  -0.33  0 You're correct for other American English differences
   0.00  1 First of all, we're seeing very strong growth in our Revel product
   0.00  1 It's at over 50% volume growth year-on-year
   0.00  1 It delivers a killer mobile experience that our customers love
   0.00  1 That's indicative, I think, of the R&D and pipeline that will drive further volume and share, and therefore, commercial value out of that
  -0.08  0 We've been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning into very important foundational areas in learning, in mathematics and in writing
   0.00  1 The South Africa K-12 textbook market is a very solid business for us
   0.00 -1 It is indeed as you've said, a cyclical business
   0.00  1 So as you correctly pointed out, this year's numbers were helped somehow by 3 exceptional orders that we had from provinces in South Africa at the end of last year
   0.14  0 And this obviously depends on a government procurement process, which is cyclical
   0.00 -1 But all in all, the market is still not at its peak
   0.00  1 So yes, we may have some ups and downs, but it's a solid business, pretty much like other businesses we have in the growth markets
  -0.50  0 Next question comes from Ian here
  -0.33  0 2017, it actually disappeared from the presentation at all
   0.00 -1 Obviously, you've got Learning Studios, which is also sort of coming down as well
  -0.10  1 So I think the sort of commentary was that sort of 2020, 2021, we should start to see the revenue growth coming through some of these new contracts coming through
   0.20  0 So just wonder if you could comment on that as well, please?  Okay
   0.00  1 And in the U.K., we're expecting growth in our qualifications business here as well as growth in Pearson Tests of English and OPM
   0.00  1 I think we are clear that 70% of our business is growing, and you can hear the drivers
   0.00  1 On the first point, our actual net revenues last year were up
   0.00  1 So if you take gross sales minus actual returns, our net sales were up
   0.00 -1 And as you heard, enrollments were down
   0.00 -1 So dividing one by the other means that revenue per enrollment started to recover last year
   0.00  1 And as a result, I think, what we're now seeing is that revenue per involvement will start to grow
  -0.06  1 We're first to have to renew contracts, so I think a better measure of performance is what's happening to enrollment growth, what's happening to new contracts, how we're growing and expanding the market
   0.07  0 Further -- and it's really an important, we're looking at and selecting programs and new partners or customers based on what we know the highest demand is
  -0.25  0  Sitting in the wrong part of the room
   0.00 -1 I do apologize
  -0.25  0 I had -- I want to ask another question about OPM
   0.00 -1 So I apologize about that
   0.00 -1 And as a consequence and as you've said might prove not to be right
   0.00 -1 the ability to rollover deals
   0.00  1 We think that there are growing revenues synergies and cost synergies with the -- on the graduate market for the reasons that -- the reason that Kevin explained
   0.00  1 And I think also we do want to grow the top line of that business as aggressively as possible
   0.00  1 But we also want to grow it in a sustainable way
  -0.04  1 So the commitments we will make to our customers are the commitments that we are confident we can deliver on and they're the ones that actually make rational economic sense in terms of the level of investment that we're willing to make and the belief that over a 7- year contract, we're actually going to make a reasonable return on that investment
   0.00  1 So I think we feel that we've got the right balance, and it is really important to take a long-term view and to see this within the overall context of the portfolio and the revenue and cost synergies that it will bring over time
  -0.11  0 And I suppose you're alluding to the same gauge on limited model coming down the pipe
   0.33  0 So can you just give a -- share any insights on early impressions of that model?  Yes
   0.00  1 So both on the inclusive access model and the print rental model, these are the things that we've really worked hard to operationalize over the last 2 or 3 years
   0.00  1 So we think the steps and the pace that we're taking has put us on a path to do this as quickly as possible and as practical in order to keep our stakeholders with us
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -1.00  0 So hopefully my questions are not out of date
  -1.00  0 But 3 questions as always
  -0.10  0  And the rational, I'd ask Rob to pick up on BTEC registration and the outlook for the U.K
   0.06 -1 It is one, as you heard from Coram, one of the lowest margin and least profitable businesses in the company, and it requires significant capital investment in print-led programs that have very little synergies with the rest of the company
   0.00  1 We have a very strong virtual schools business
   0.09  0 And you remember, we're also retaining both the advanced placement and career and technical education part of our K-12 business
  -0.50  0 Thanks for the question
   0.00  1 I think if I was an American I'd say I'm quite excited about the prospect of the growth that we have in qualifications
   0.00 -1 In the last few years, we have been impacted by education policy changes that have affected the size of the market that we work, and it's particularly impacted on BTEC
   0.50  0 Just a couple of things, please
   0.00 -1 It turned out to be only 2%
  -0.10  0 And finally, on unlimited, I don't think the -- you sort of quite said how you thought Unlimited was going
   0.00  1 And you would think given Pearson's market share, it will be well above 1.1
    nan  1 Good
  -0.14  0 And I have to say that I don't really buy into the claims that adoptions are going away
   0.00 -1 It's not happening
   0.17  0 There is conversation, but it leads us back to what we're doing really well, which is taking into account all 3 customers
   0.06  0 And what they're more interested in is really talking about outcomes and the data that can get to, to help bolster enrollments, keep students in the classroom, whether it be online or bricks and mortar, and then outcomes that are associated with that
  -0.06  0 And instructors and administrators are using those dashboards to actually see when the student's not performing well and how they can intervene real time versus those that are doing really well and asking the questions as to why and how can we replicate that and duplicate it
   0.08  0 Coram, do you want to pick up on the operating profit contribution from higher education and this inventory point?  Sure
   0.00  1 And that allows us to take central costs, manage them centrally, have real visibility into them
  -0.11  1 And as you know, we think that those costs are too high, and it's the way in which we control them and will reduce them as part of the restructuring program
  -0.08  0 In terms of the inventory correction, I think, John made a point that on an actual basis, in other words, if you look at actual sales and actual returns, then we were up last year
   0.17  0 So that's why you get 2% benefit on an accounting basis
   0.33  0 The actual benefit would have been higher than that
   0.33 -1 But we don't have perfect visibility
   0.00  1 We've got 2 more returns periods to go this year, that's why we're giving you a bigger range
   0.00 -1 We do believe there will be ongoing reduction in returns
  -0.25  0 So -- sorry, 2 more questions, and then we'll wrap it up
   0.00  1 Is the base solid enough that you can actually look at growth M&A?  Okay
  -0.50  0 It's a good question
   0.00  1 It's a good and perfectly sensible question
   0.00  1 So everybody can hear you..
   0.00  1 I think the demand for virtual schooling in that space is going to continue to grow
   0.00  1 And the good news for us is the barrier to entry is really hard, given the regulatory environment
   0.00  1 It's pretty nice to avoid Trump today, so
   0.06  0 You remember that 5 years ago we made this commitment that by this year we'll be in a position to report on an externally audited independently verified basis on the efficacy of our products
  -0.25  0 Second question, well, I think, Albert just said yes
   0.00  1 So we're seeing the fruits of all of that simplification, and that's coming through the GBP 300 million cost-reduction plan
  -0.13  0 So other flavors I can give you, a whole new content ecosystem was implemented last year, new content offering, distribution, storage, all of that was replaced with new systems, and new e-commerce platform went in last year
   0.00  1 Global learning platform, which is our really exciting micro services cloud-based platform that'll host all our content in the future
   0.00  1 At scale, the platform is infinitely scalable comparable to the best digital services platforms out there in the world today
   0.00  1 It's going well
   0.00  1 It's delivering
   0.00  1 We're seeing the cost savings and everything is on track
  -0.12  0 So specifically, on Watson, we've released our first product for testing last fall, limited pilot
   0.00  1 We're encouraged by what we've seen so far, and we feel like we're on track and sort of link that to Albert's calling about sort of GLP and the early comments about our organic sort of R&D in applications artificial and machine intelligence
   0.00  1 I think we've got a very strong pipeline and we'll have a platform that will allow much more rapid prototyping validation and then sort of commercialization or productization of these kinds of services
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00 -1 Because I think what we learned in the past was that our ability to integrate those companies was very limited
  -0.33  0 Final question, and then we'll call it a day
  -0.10  0 It strikes me that if you look at the range of possibilities for North America higher ed courseware and do a kind of 70% drop-through on that, that's a swing of 40
  -0.25  0 Second question, on your savings target
   0.12  0 You mentioned that there's better -- the FX at the end of 2016, so if we mark-to-market, what's that 300?  Okay
  -0.14  0 And so -- in turn -- let me take the FX question on the savings first
   0.20  0 But obviously, would be offset depending on where we land in higher ed
   0.00  1 And on that, thanks again for your interest
   0.00  1 Gio, Tom and Angela are all here, and we're very happy to take your questions, any follow-up you may have in the course of today, but good to see you all

---FILE: Persimmon Plc.txt

   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.12  0 And the combined effect of that, giving us a 51.5% return on capital employed figure for the year
   0.00  1 The whole of the management team of Persimmon is very focused in the business, as you can imagine, on producing these results
   0.00  1 And I think, it's a good start to the year with forward sales revenue standing at an increase 7.5% to over GBP 2 billion
   0.00  1 Good free cash generation in 2017 over GBP 800 million, which was an 18% increase over the prior year
   0.00  1 So as we say, we've got strong operational fundamentals
   0.00  1 Nottingham opened at the beginning of 2017, which is now performing very strongly and quickly got up-to-speed
   0.00  1 And we believe that the operating companies can operate very well at around 650 units per annum
   0.00 -1 Our average selling price is still at the lower end of the industry
  -1.00  0 And that is very much intentional
   0.00 -1 In fact, rates have continued to trend down slightly over the next 6 months
   0.00  1 Demand remains very strong
   0.00  1 As I mentioned, we worked really hard to meet the demand that we're seeing -- that we've seen during the course of the year, nearly 900 extra units legally completed to over 16,000 units
   0.00  1 You can see the North has performed strongly with 7% completion growth in the year
   0.00  1 But generally, a good picture right across the board
   0.00  1 I think the key features for me are still a very good supportive land market
   0.00  1 And I think the strategic -- ex-strategic content in land bank is important and enables us to continue to drive further value in the business
  -0.18  1 We replaced over 17,000 plots in the year and we invested quite strongly, over GBP 600 million invested into land during the course of the year, which is quite a sizable increase over the prior year
   0.00  1 Strategic land is working well
   0.00  1 We've got a really good team there
   0.00  1 And with good conversion rates as you can see, over 8,200 plots converted in the year from 28 locations
   0.00  1 The average size of the sites is increasing
   0.00 -1 And actually is an issue for the industry in terms of delivery of volume going forward
   0.08 -1 We're producing more volume on the same number of sites, which does drive efficiency, but also is a bit limited in terms of opportunity in the market for buyers and for resource
   0.00  1 So I think good that we've managed to acquire more strategic land in the year replacing the land that we brought through
   0.00  1   Space4 is certainly seeing good increases during the course of the year, and producing good volumes for us both in house kits and also roof systems as well
   0.00  1 Last year, we made payments of GBP 1.35, and to-date, we've returned a total of nearly GBP 1.5 billion since we introduced the plan in 2012, which is significantly ahead of plan
   0.00  1 So today, we're pleased to announce that we're now more than doubling the value that returning to shareholders over this planned period to GBP 13 per share, which as well as the running dividend of 110p per share paid in July each year, we're also paying for the next 3 years, GBP 1.25 in late March, early April of each year
   0.00  1 The economy remains good
   0.00  1 We're seeing good disciplined lending, good mortgage offers as I mentioned
   0.00  1 So the priorities for the business now is to continue to invest in our sales network, and as I say, we've got good sites coming forward
   0.00 -1 Increase the construction further, there is a challenge
   0.17  0 And we expect that to be constructed during the course of this year and delivering tiles to our sites during the course of next year
   0.00  1 So that's an important feature really, as we try as Persimmon to control our ability to deliver volume going forward to de-risk some of the supply issues that we've been seeing over the last few years
   0.00  1 So the incremental increases in production, we hope to continue to see as the industry continues to move forward
   0.05  0 And I think it's important to perhaps just sort of track through the philosophy around the capital return and the levels of cash that the business, certainly the board consider as appropriate to hold, albeit that can change depending on where we perceive we are in the cycle
   0.00  1 And I think the growth of the business is all about growth, quality and cash generation
   0.00  1 And the results of all that work will generate higher levels of free cash generation
   0.00  1 Volume increase is obviously important, its cash a generator in its own right
   0.00  1 So to continue to grow each of our 30 businesses now in those regional markets to sustainable scale is very important
   0.17  0 So the lenders are always looking at the secondhand market for a lead in terms of pricing
   0.00  1 And I think the tighter regulation around lending should support, hopefully, a more sustainable market moving further out in terms of the Bank of England supervision that we have with the MMR and other movements, other changes that have happened over recent years
   0.00  1 350 basis point increase in gross margin year-on-year to this record high of 31.3% for the business
   0.14  0 And then we've got the build, where the weight of money, if you will, is behind delivering the net gross profit per unit
   0.00  1 So you can see there that we've been able to capture around about of GBP 6,500 per unit in additional price
  -0.11  0 So I think let's just think about that build area because it really is quite interesting
   0.00  1 And you've heard us sort of touch on this before, in that it -- you've got to work very, very hard on many, many things to deliver this sort of performance
   0.05  0 That's where all the activity, more or less happens in terms of development works and that's where the weight of money is directed in terms of our development processes and construction processes in developing sites, putting the infrastructure in and developing the units to hand over to our customers
   0.00  1 So just over GBP 2,000 was the reduction in our on-site costs
   0.00  1 And there's also some, I mean, for example, our health and safety routines are very, very strong
  -0.06  0 But also what it means is, for example, we're able to take a slightly different view on our insurances, contract works, public liability insurances, where we can -- we have the surety of our principal controls in this area
   0.00  1 So we can reassess our insurance covers, which allows us to become more efficient in terms of covering that risk forward
   0.00  1 That adds value to the margin
   0.20  0 So that sort of GBP 2,000 position is a net position after incurring a certain amount of build cost
   0.00 -1 And now we've had the detail for the year, we would estimate our supply chain build cost pressure is around about 2.5% for '17
   0.10  0 So if you back out that from the sort of GBP 2,100 net position, that would indicate the cost inflation accounts for about GBP 2,500 to GBP 2,400
   0.00  1 We've incurred a bit of build cost inflation, but we've also -- we worked very hard to generate other savings in the build cost area
   0.00  1 So that's the really interesting bit
   0.00  1 And Jeff's already said the Northern patch of our business has done extremely well in 2017; around about 42% of our total legals have come from out of our Northern Persimmon patch compared with less than 40% last year
   0.00  1 We've got a 25% increase in affordable delivery
   0.33  0 And that feeds into the overall position
   0.00  1 We're very proud of our Westbury units
   0.20  0 In terms of the layouts that we're achieving on new sites
   0.00  1 So that is also adding extra value as that comes through
   0.00  1 I mean, Space4, we've increased the throughput and the output from the Space4 factory to over 6,500 units combined of kits and the roof systems
   0.20  0 Space4 isn't a profit center
   0.00  1 And that translates into lower build costs
   0.00  1 But all these little things add up, and you've got to keep on working very hard to deliver these operational gains
   0.00  1 All adds up to deliver these sorts of performances
   0.00  1 And that's why, Jeff mentioned Brickworks, mentioned tile works, these are further steps in that direction to support margin
  -0.17  1 The intensity of scrutiny within the business through our evaluation processes is very disciplined
  -0.50  0 And there'll be a question
   0.00  1 And as I say, record highs for Persimmon
   0.00  1 I mean Jeff's very proud about the quality that's embedded in the land bank, as we all are
   0.00 -1 So again, please don't take this away in thinking, well, there's another 200 bps of margin to drop through next year because as you guys know, it doesn't work like that
   0.00  1 But all that comes together to deliver our end margins
   0.10  0 I think the one thing that we can say, when we look at the pipeline of our new sites, then it seems to us that at this point in time looking at spot pricing, if you will, then the margins in the future land and our expectations around delivering margins are similar to some improvements, some perhaps, possibility of improvement moving down the track from where we are today
   0.00 -1 But it is being realistic margins are going to plateau off at some points
   0.00  1 And he wants light to be shown into every dark corner to try and deliver a bit more value, if we can, and we'll continue to do that tirelessly
   0.00 -1 But again, as I've said already, there's a lot of moving parts in this equation and we'll have to see what the future holds
   0.00  1 But we are very keen on maintaining this higher level of asset turn because that speaks to the cash intensity of the business
   0.00  1 And I think this is delivering more from less, type mantra
   0.00  1 Capital return, well, cash generation first
   0.00  1 And obviously, very strong cash generation in '17 of over GBP 800 million
   0.05  0 And you can see in the graph, it's all about at this point in the cycle, the combination of that growth quality cash generation comes through clearly, I think in that slide, where you've got the cash from operating activities going hand-in-hand with the underlying operating profit, which is your redline
   0.09  0 I'd like to think that we are progressive in terms of our annual reviews, our continual reviews of the amounts of capital we do return
   0.00  1 Jeff's already touched on the announcement today of increasing the capital return by committing to 3 specials; 125p per share over the next 3 years
   0.00  1 But also the liquidity that we generate does give us other opportunities
  -0.09  0 And I think the -- I think it's worthwhile just very quickly touching through the philosophy around, how we deal with our capital -- excess capital that we generate
  -0.11  0 We want the liquidity to invest in the business at the right time, in the right land, in the right locations
  -0.33  0 I can hear the question going through your minds
   0.00  1 We've got huge amounts of strategic land in the pipeline that we need to be able to support bringing that through to deliver the value for our shareholders
   0.20  0   The GBP 758,000 mark, I think, is reasonable position to take
   0.20  0 So arguably, slightly longer that sort of position
   0.00  1 But obviously, through this year, we've done exceedingly well in generating further cash, which has obviously been a real fill-it for the board to be able to assess the additional return
   0.06  0 But over and above the working capital requirement and the reinvestment needs in terms of land or additional land opportunities, we then get into surplus capital, and that's what underwrites the GBP 1.10 longer-term commitment
  -0.50  0 Well, we name that excess capital
   0.00  1 This is ensuring that we remain fully aligned to the core of the strategy, which is capital discipline
  -0.12  0 As we said before, so it's entirely logical to look at, if we have excess capital, if we have the choice, if you will, if we've earned that choice, well, do we deploy a bit of cash there to prevent a further extension of the equity base? As being a preferable choice to expanding the equity base, which would be contradictory to the philosophy behind the strategy I believe
  -0.17  0 The number of shares that are issued -- that are likely to be issued drop to around about GBP 4 million for the 40% that vested at the end of December
  -0.18  0 If the board decides to net settle at that point, you can see that the share count drops or the number of shares that would issued will drop from 11.2 million to 5.4 million as a result of that with cash going to HMRC on a net settle basis
   0.00  1 We've invested in good quality land and we generated a strong free cash through the course of the year, whilst minimizing the risk to the business
   0.00  1 And we've also, the combination of that is a substantial increase in the return to our shareholders
   0.00  1 And I think it's fair to say, we've have had a good start to the year, so far 8 weeks trading, but there's still an awful a lot to do
  -0.10  0 I think I would also like to refer to the notice that went out today about Nicholas Wrigley and his resignation from the board as of yesterday's date
   0.00  1 And we wish him very well in that respect
   0.00  1   Finally, I'd like to say that we thank everybody who has assisted us in the process, all of our subcontracts, supply chain and all the other stakeholders in the business who support us so well
  -0.25  0 I'm sure there's a few questions
  -0.20  0 You can tell us your name, your organization and we'll do our best to answer your questions
   0.00 -1 Obviously, the second half I think we were kind of just shy of 29%, I believe 28.8% it was
   0.10  0 And I guess, what you were saying was flat to maybe up depending a little bit on market conditions just to clarify that statement
  -0.50  0 The second question is on..
   0.33  0 Maybe it's easier this way
   0.00 -1 There's a lot of uncertainty in the market
   0.00 -1 There's a lot of headwinds out there
   0.00  1 So the quality of the land bank is outstanding
   0.00  1 I think they're pretty good levels anyway
   0.11 -1 But that doesn't mean to say that we arent going to start trying to improve on it
  -0.20  1 I guess, the bar was -- it's raised, the better you do, unfortunately
  -0.33  0 Then the second question is on cash consumptions
   0.00 -1 So last year, I think you had said GBP 20 million of working capital consumption, which is obviously extremely low, considering the growth
   0.06  0 I want to get a better sense of sort of how do you think about next few years if the business continues to grow, do you actually start thinking about net expansion of your capital, more with less kind of a support?    Yes, exactly
   0.33  0 I mean the key -- the 2 big drivers of that is the land and work in progress
   0.00 -1 But it continues to be incredibly challenging not, at least, because of those constraints in terms of availability in materials and labor
   0.00  1 It's getting ahead of where we think it's sensible to get ahead
  -0.11  0 Because it -- it can become inefficient as well, can't it?  Yes, I mean, if you look at the feature of the industry, it's that we have moved more towards the bigger sites
   0.12  0 But there's an upper ceiling level to what can actually be achieved on those developments
   0.25  0 The cash payment would effectively be a reserve movement
  -0.06  0 It would seem contradictory to expand your equity base at a time when you're trying to constrain your capital base through the additional capital return, which obviously, is a charge against your reserves by way of dividends
  -0.33  0 But my second question is just on Space4
   0.00  1 It's very supportive of what we're doing
   0.33  0 It does depend on a number of factors
   0.17  0 So in the foremost of time, that may well happen, but it need not necessarily be the next opportunity
   0.00  1 But certainly, it's working well for us
   0.13  0 How should we think about volume growth from here with those things in mind on maybe a 3 or 4-year view?  I think the volume growth, Jon, really depends on outlet position
   0.00  1 So really, we see the next level of growth being delivered through further expansion of the infrastructure and outlet network to a large degree
   1.00  0 Three as well, if I could, please
  -0.50  0 This is all disclosed, by the way, in the RNS
   0.05  0 Where we've seen is -- where we've seen a bit of growth come through is in plots that we own, which are progressing towards detailed consent, where we got outstanding planning conditions, which to Jeff's earlier point, hopefully the changes that we're going to see coming through, the revised NPPF in March
   0.00 -1 But as Jeff says, it's still pretty frustrating in getting onto site and allowing ourselves that opportunity
   0.00  1 We're committing to sourcing everything that we need for a good number of months and years
   0.25  0 Because all our supply chain depend on it as well
  -0.09  0 If we can only commit for 3 months' worth of provision of door kits or whatever it is, well that's all a bit stop-start and here we go again, we're into 2008, where's the work coming from
   0.07  0  I think, just another linked point to that, the size of the sites that I've been referring to, those tend to lead to more significant infrastructure having to be installed before you can actually access the housing and deliver regular completions off them
  -0.10  0 So the bigger the site tends to be the more complicated and time-consuming it is before you can actually start to get legal completions of those
   0.00  1 Again, that's another important feature
   0.20  0 It's off-site works, enabling works, as Jeff says
   0.10 -1  I mean -- I suppose the only caveat to that would -- even if there's some lumpy strategic successes that we get through planning may influence things a little bit
  -0.17  0 Last year, it moved around quite a bit half on, half in
  -0.20  0 Which it was quite -- it's almost a mirror image, if you will, in that regard
  -0.07  0 It's difficult again to predict in terms of how that's going to come through because we've already commented that we have got a lot of plots there that are waiting for detailed consent, which obviously, are going to deliver a good number of those sites
   0.00 -1 So I would hesitate predicting what the shape of that
   0.00  1 All I would hope is that, your 370% mark, as an average for last year, is something that we will be able to match
   0.00  1 I think that's where -- that's all really we can say, isn't it, really, in terms of -- I mean, we've got good visibility, as Jeff says, but -- and we're working very hard to get those up and running
   0.00 -1 So there's a bit of a factor there
  -0.20  0 Because obviously the 25% increase in affordable content influences that as well
   0.00 -1 Any more of those creeping out at the moment now we've seen slightly softer house participation?  No, we do get -- we do get occasional down valuations
   0.00  1 We're very realistic about that
   0.00 -1 And we do still see down -- not massive down valuations but that tension is there in the market
   0.14  0 We've not heard -- and we've not heard any details that would inform us any -- with any -- to form a different view
   0.00 -1 Because, obviously, it impinges on our appetite to invest
   0.00  1 And that's why it's important
  -0.17  0 I mean, Jeff pushes all the teams to do the best land deals that they can because that's our the first line of defense, if you think about it
   0.00  1 It's a very a defensive position to take
   0.00  1 Yes, it delivers and embeds more value in the business for the future if you've got a constant market
   0.00  1 We're big supporters of the scheme because it allows customers to enter the housing market
   0.00  1 But we do target particularly the first time -- our first-time mover markets, so that's why we're a strong user of it
   0.00  1 And I think it functions very well
   0.00  1 And the lenders are very keen to support it as well
   0.00 -1 So I mean, if we Help to Buy was removed, you may see a slackening in of the rate sale, we would anticipate
   0.00  1 So I think that's important
   0.00  1 House builders have been a big driver of the economy
   0.00  1 Jobs -- and from that point of view, it's worked very well, I think
   0.00  1 And we can see that it has generated additional volume
   0.00  1 And it's generating a pretty decent return, or should be, for the taxpayer
   0.00 -1 It was a necessary move by successive governments to try and support the housing market in a time when -- obviously, because of the financial crisis, mortgage lenders risk appetite changed dramatically
   0.00  1 I mean that's on the record
   0.00  1 So the government, firstly, looking to generate more growth in the domestic economy and, secondly, support customers
  -1.00  0  Next question over there
   0.00 -1 I know you've talked at length about the margin sustainability, or not
   0.00 -1 I'm just a little bit surprised by your comment that there wasn't another 200 basis points on the margin, given that you've got a plot cost to revenue ratio in the land bank, which is 3 percentage points below what you've put through the income statement today, or..
   0.00 -1  I don't think you should be surprised
   0.00  1 So mix is very, very important
   0.00  1  The good thing about that is, obviously, you've got more value into the future to support margin as you go forward
  -0.06  0 Can you just give us a little bit of color?  I think the -- I mean, what I'd just caution you to getting too focused on plot cost of revenue percentage as being the sole reason for why margin can change
  -0.04  0 And as we've already referenced, we're putting a lot of money in the ground in terms of infrastructure works, et cetera, which complement the land -- just to paint a simpler example: we find a 10-acre site in the middle of Wales, which requires a lot of heavy in engineering and ground works to cut levels into the hillside
   0.00  1 So you look at that, if you got one-dimensional view, at what margin would be delivered from that, You say, "That is going to be a super margin." Because it's a 10% cost of revenue percentage
  -0.09  0 So I think the best way we can answer your question is that, when we look at the land that we have acquired and is coming through our pipeline to be acquired, the margin is pretty similar
   0.00  1  So that's what we're driving now?  It's an indicator really, which is good indicator
  -0.33  0 And then the second question was on the -- this land banking review
   0.00 -1 I think the key point that's being looked at specifically at the moment, by Oliver Letwin, is the issue of is the industry building at suitably faster rate, given the demand in the market
  -0.20  0 And this is quite a narrower sort of point actually
  -0.17  0 So we're quite -- we haven't got anything to fear about a review about the use of land
  -0.20  0 So on a big site, it can be quite a lot further into the process
   0.00  1 So we are quite confident about the outcome of that, from our perspective, but I think it will drive into a further debate going forward
   0.25  0 I've got 3, but I'll do the quick easy ones first
  -0.12  0  I think it's very hard to predict, Clyde, in terms of the balance of upfront payments vis-à-vis deferred
   0.00  1 And hopefully, the revised NPPF that we'll see in March will provide further impetus to get us there
   0.00 -1 Because we have seen a bit more competition in one or two spots
   0.00 -1 But how all of that sort balances out, I think we -- I mean, from a financial point of view -- I mean, it's obviously a continuing debate in the business
   0.00  1  So it's turning over reasonably well
  -0.11  0 I think another important point is, there, that we do buy land usually on a subjective planning basis
  -0.09  0 So we only contract or complete on it -- complete, should I say, at the point we've got a suitable planning consent
   0.10  0 How do you see that moving in the next couple of years?  Yes, I think we're getting into the sort of top end of what is achievable
   0.00  1 where we're getting pushed back on various standards, again, being introduced by the individual local authorities, which is very unhelpful for the industry to continue to drive volumes forward
   0.00  1 The -- I think the average selling price, up 3.2%
   0.08  0 We were looking at it from a per unit basis, so it's the GBP per unit type approach that really drives the cash that delivers, also, the profit per unit, which is a very important dimension
  -0.50  0  That's a good question
   0.12  0 And so it does depend on where your sites are in that geographical location as well, driving that individual sort of plot number
   1.00  0 Just 2 please
   0.00  1 Obviously, you had a good start to the year
   0.00 -1 And secondly, just wondered what your expectations took a bit more kind of trends and material cost and labor inflation for 2018?  I think, taking the first one from a sales incentive point, no real noticeable, Aynsley, at this point
  -0.14  0 As I say, the industry shifted quite a bit over recent years, where the harnessing digital technology -- it sounds quite a strange, a house builder talking about digital technology
   0.00  1 It's a really interesting dynamic at the moment, where all the home finder engines that are on the Internet now
  -0.17  0 So there's quite a lot of work done in that area
   0.11  0 But suffice to say that we're always trying to achieve a balanced portfolio in support of each of our 30 businesses
   0.08  0 We're continually signing up new options at the same as getting successes out of the front end of it in terms of introducing ex-strategic sites into the consented land bank
   0.17  0 So it's in the speed of -- it's not a smooth conveyer belt, in terms of tying up new option agreements and delivering the successes out the front end
   0.00  1 So it's quite a dynamic position
   0.12  0  Is very regional, actually, Glynis, and depending on who's operating in a particular area
  -0.08  0 It is quite competitive for strategic land, and there are various house builders and organizations, who can invest at the level required to -- for strategic land rather than buying land in the open market
  -0.14  1 And we've got such a good quality strategic land bank, that we don't want to deteriorate that
  -0.33  0   So we're quite choosy
   0.00  1 I thought it was really a good conversion rate but also a good replacement rate
   0.25 -1 So I was pleasantly surprised actually in that regard
    nan  1 So good
  -0.50  0  And the second question is slightly the Voldemort of the questions
   0.00  1 And actually, you have sort of ongoing margin tailwind   because of that
   0.00  1 So while you sort of talk conservatively on the margin outlook, theoretically, all else equal, these things do provide you with ongoing support here
   0.00 -1 And that job will never be finished
   0.00  1 That will certainly help to mitigate some of the other cost increases that we are seeing going forward
   0.00  1 Thanks very much for joining us, everyone
   0.00  1 Much appreciated

   0.00  1                                                               Good morning, and thank you for joining us for this results briefing
  -0.10  0 As you will have seen, the board has announced today our intention to demerge M&G Prudential, our U.K
   0.00  1 As a stand-alone business, M&G Prudential has strong capabilities in the growing savings and wealth management marketplace
   0.20  0 It will be focused on outperforming its U.K
   0.05  0 Following the demerger, Prudential plc will focus on the opportunities we have in the 2 largest insurance markets in the world, meeting the needs of the fast-growing middle-class Asian community and Americans approaching retirement
   0.10  0 The 2 independent groups will be headquartered in London, which we regard as the preeminent city from which to operate global financial service businesses
   0.00  1 The board believes this demerger is in the best long-term interest of all our stakeholders
   0.14  0 With that, I'll hand over to Mike who will talk you through our results and provide some insight into the proposed demerger
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 Well, good morning, everybody
   0.00  1 It's been a -- it's been an interesting set of results to try and prepare a summary for you today
   0.00  1 We're going to do our best to get through that
  -0.10  0 As always, we'll stay and answer any questions you have on the variety of topics and metrics and things that we are report on this
  -0.14  0 I said to a number of you when I first took this role that one of the things people underestimate about this group is its bandwidth, its capability
   0.00  1 So another strong set of broad, good financials
   0.03  0 Let's start on, if we could -- actually, I'll take this, all the key metrics: so new business profits, cash, embedded value, earnings, dividends, capital, okay? Embedded in that is a focus on quality of earnings; health and protection focus; Asia, you have IFRS up 15% in Asia; health and protection, up 26%; the U.S
   0.00  1 record net flows and the M&G at over GBP 17 billion and the with-profits fund as well [ at 9% ]; IFRS earnings, up 10%; and the M&G Prudential dividend, up 8%, and again, all of this while maintaining a very robust solvency level
   0.20  0 We're not solving for anything as we get to some of the more strategic conversations today
  -0.25  1 Not to be lost in our discussion, all of the 2017 objectives have been achieved
  -0.12  0 We go back to the, again, my 23 years here, we've run 3 sets of objectives over time through Asia primarily, with some group metrics in them
   0.12 -1 At various points, there was tremendous debate about the resilience and validity even of our Asian assumptions
   0.00  1 So yes, I've been here that long and they've done that good a job, both reasonable takeaways from that
  -0.14  0 While Asia was growing, while they were meeting those objectives, you also saw material changes, active management of the portfolio
   0.00  1 and the international business have scale, I think, by any attributes, which brings us to the announcement on the demerger
   0.20  0 competes internally as it should, okay, for opportunities we have around the globe
   0.00  1 It has the breadth of product, capability, management team, technology
  -0.12  0 But the divestiture itself doesn't affect the dividend capability of the firm in either structure
   0.14  0 Same risk, same, governance both based here, both headquartered here, again listed here, premier listings
   0.00  1 So all of those things that produced the results, that got these businesses here remain intact and that includes the risk management, governance, all of the elements that control the quality of those earnings, quality of those sales
   0.00  1 Its ambitions are clearly to take some of the things that are working well in M&G and Asia, some of the things that are working well with the U.K
   0.00  1 You see that in the strong financial performance, you see that in the net flows and you see that in the operating income
   0.00  1 And on the PruFund, a record GBP 9 billion of net flows
   0.00  1 These businesses are performing well
   0.10  0 It's business as usual while they're getting integrated and while they're findings synergies as we committed to you they would
   0.20  0   So a quick update on the merger and transformation progress
   0.00  1 It's also consumer-facing service capability that we want to upgrade and can very, very quickly with their capabilities
   0.14  0 We are in a position for anything the political environment can throw at us within reason on that front
  -0.10  0 And then the last piece on the Rothesay transaction will be the Part VII, the full transfer, and that is subject to Court approval
   0.00  1 It's complete the work here that produces independent balance sheets, strong balance sheets, well-capitalized firms
   0.00  1 So -- and the back book transaction with Rothesay released a little over GBP 1 billion in capital and that's going to be retained in the group to maintain the structural and strategic flexibility we're talking about here today
   0.00  1 So we think the structural demands in Asia remain unique
   0.10  0 But they're learning how to be effective wholesalers of a different product, a different structure in a different space
   0.17  0 I wanted to give you a slightly different look at the success in Asia
   0.00  1 So we've talked about a number of countries where we're top 3, it's 9, 8 countries with double-digit growth
  -0.11  0 But here's a different cut on the actual size, the absolute size of the businesses we have in Asia now
   0.00 -1 And this goes back to scale and this goes back to we do compete with new competitors, their ambitions in Asia are as X amount of countries versus necessarily profit per country and things and that can be challenging and it's one of the many things the local teams have dealt with for as long as I've been here
  -0.33  1 But I thought this was a really good cut at what you own in Asia
   0.20  0 The focus on the teams is on   profit
  -0.20  0 They are limited in some of the products that we won't let them compete with
   0.00  1 But the absolute scale of them, I think, is something the team there needs to be very proud of
   0.00  1 But there's quite effective utilization of the brand
   0.09  0 If you almost went down the size of these businesses, the issues that the CEOs and their teams deal with get more similar and so the relationships and the sharing gets more enthusiastic
  -0.08  0 In my travels there, it is generally one of -- people's very -- it's one of the earliest conversations they bring up on personal concerns and education tends to be the second for family members
  -0.11  0 So there's quite a focus by the parents and the working children on the liability of that model and how you fund that
   0.00 -1 Penetration stays low
   0.00  1 On the upper end of the market, you are seeing a very, very fast growth and you hear this from competitors that own advice platforms there in wealth management, in wealth solutions
   0.00  1 business
   0.09  0 These consumers know that when they go to retire, they have X amount of income coming and it is no different than with-profits client in the U.K
   0.25  0 looking to smooth the edges on the market
  -0.17  0 Remember, these weren't forced allocation models
  -0.03  1 They participated about 70-30 in equities, disproportionately value funds, with very good fund managers, again actively selected, actively added and deleted based on performance, okay, and the balance of it is in bonds and guaranteed funds and they got a very good return relative to market and they own the product for accumulation until it's time to retire, exactly as it was designed to perform, okay? So with that, with a quality product, you get some very good outcomes
   0.00 -1 And for those of you that haven't been sitting here a long time, we never believed in the GMIB product
   0.00  1 So it is a very differentiated company than some of the other firms that it competes with
   0.00  1 Well, if you're a consumer, you get the best return
   0.11  0 They hate services using companies, it's performed as they suggested it would, that's valuable
   0.00  1 It also has the top- rated wholesaling teams, the support for the advisers in the United States
   0.00  1 Okay, well, that's good, and that's retroactive in its measurement
   0.00 -1 So we can't beat everybody's product
   0.00  1 But that's a capability the firm has as well
   0.00 -1 On an economic basis, it's only good
  -0.22  0 So I've argued with you, I think, since -- as I took this role and with some of you before that, I think this is the fairest cut to look at us
   0.00  1 And again, I think this is the best report card on the group
   0.00  1 I think it shows the growth is not only in earnings, but its future earnings, it's also in cash and that should translate to and it has a consistent growing dividend
   0.00  1 So again, today, we announced an 8% increase in our dividend
   0.00  1 It's well supported
   0.00  1 It's a high-quality dividend
   0.00  1 It's a highly predictable dividend and I think that's -- it should rate at the upper end of its peers
   0.00  1 Mark?  Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to you all
   0.09  0 It is understandable, of course, that our strategic announcement today has drawn most of the interest, but hopefully not to the complete exclusion of our financial performance in 2017
   0.00  1 This set of results adds another period in a long-established trend of growth in scale and in quality
   0.00  1 And free surplus generation at GBP 3.64 billion on a headline basis and was up by 9% on an underlying basis before variances
   0.12  0 Currency effects have added between 3 to 5 percentage points to reported growth rates in 2017
   0.12  0 Although with sterling strengthening over the year, this is likely to reverse in 2018 based on current spot rates
   0.18  0 As in previous years, we continue to reference constant currency movements as a better indication of the underlying financial progress of the group
   0.00  1 Our healthy balance sheet and Solvency II surplus remains key to our ability to successfully absorb movements in macroeconomic and other external factors
   0.00  1 In particular, those are that: one, Asia remains the fastest-growing part of our business; two, that each of our businesses in Asia, the U.S
   0.00  1 and Europe have delivered growth in earnings across both life and asset management; and three, that consistent with our strategy in the areas that we are looking to grow, we are growing
   0.00  1 These operations underpin the group results for 2017 and remain the focus of our growth ambitions and capital investment
   0.00 -1 where reinvestment yields remained below the portfolio return
   0.00  1 In asset management, Eastspring has had another good year
   0.00  1 With combined IFRS profit of GBP 1.975 billion in 2017, our Asia businesses have exceeded their 2017 objectives and continue to generate high levels of growth with increasing quality and breadth
   0.00  1 In the U.S., the accumulation of variable annuity assets continues to drive Jackson's earnings
   0.00  1 Average separate account assets increased by 17% to GBP 125 billion, primarily due to strong investment performance, consistent with the rise of the U.S
   0.00  1 Overall, fee-based earnings increased by 12% to GBP 1.788 billion
   0.00 -1 Earnings from spread-based business decreased by 6%, reflecting the impact of the anticipated reduction in spread margins
   0.09 -1 This move down in spreads is due to both lower reinvestment yields and lower positive contribution from duration management swaps as they continue to roll off
  -0.25  1 yields may help to reduce the speed of the decline
  -0.11  0 The 2017 year-end balance sheet impacts primarily relate to a lower level of deferred tax assets
  -0.25  0 Notwithstanding this, Jackson obviously remains in excess of 400%
   0.05  0 The stated year-end statutory capital position does not take into account any estimate of the impact of required capital as, at this stage, the NAIC is yet to make public how it intends to incorporate tax reform into its assessment of capital
   0.12  0 We will, of course, participate fully in these discussions and update you once this position is clearer
   0.00  1 This decline in ETR incorporates a new headline corporate tax rate of 21% and a continued benefit from the DRD, which is worth about another 3 percentage points under the new tax regime
   0.00  1 M&G Prudential continues to work towards this transformation to a modern savings and investment business and is on track to deliver the GBP 145 million annual savings we set out in August
   0.00  1 Given the fast-growing scale of the PruFund assets, we expect it to become increasingly material to the U.K
   0.00  1 result
   0.14  0 Our provision does not include the benefit of potential insurance recoveries of up to GBP 175 million
   0.03  0 I've included within IFRS operating profit, there are 3 main items to note: firstly, the additional restructuring costs of GBP 44 million relating to the M&G Prudential merger and transformation program; secondly, the GBP 50 million cost of implementing the 11 platform across the group; and thirdly, the additional interest cost of GBP 65 million related to debt issued during 2016 together with currency effects
   0.00  1 In Asia, NBP has increased by 12% with health and protection contributing growth of 26% as we continue to pivot the business towards protection income, in line with our strategic focus
   0.00  1 In Hong Kong, NBP was 8% higher; and outside Hong Kong, NBP was up 20%
   0.00  1 And both agency and bancassurance channels recorded double-digit growth
  -0.08  0 How and where we invest our capital and how we manage that business once it's on our books has a direct correlation to the conversion of in-force value into cash and capital generation
   0.00  1 This highlights that each of our businesses had generated growing contributions as expected, given the growth in the life portfolio and the strong year for our asset management operations
  -0.11  1 After investment in new business, the underlying movement in 2017 before variances and restructuring costs was an increase of 9% compared to 2016
   0.18  0 Asia remains the primary destination of our new business investment, accounting for over half the total in 2017, reflecting the relative scale of the opportunities there
  -0.06  0 Under Solvency II, this includes an amount that relates to the with- profits business, reflecting shareholders' participation in the downside scenarios of some 1-in-200 stress events at current interest levels
  -0.08  1 We continue to run the group to a robust solvency capital position with a shareholder Solvency II surplus of GBP 13.3 billion at the end of 2017
   0.00  1 As expected, given the growth in the business, both own funds and the SCR have increased over the period
  -0.09  1 Our strong group solvency position is replicated at the local regulatory level 2 with capital well in excess of regulatory requirements
   0.08  0 RBC does not include the benefit of swap gains from use of the permitted practice, which, if included, would add another 45 points to the year-end ratio
   0.20  0   My next slide provides you with the usual bridge between the 2016 surplus and the 2017 position
  -0.09  1 Operating capital generation of GBP 3.2 billion remains the key driver of the change, which has helped to absorb the adverse day 1 impact of U.S
   0.00  1 The sensitivities on the right-hand side of the slide continue to demonstrate that our Solvency II position remains resilient to market stress while retaining the upside potential from a favored market position
   0.00  1 We continue to hold significant levers within the group and at business unit level, to manage external market effects, combined with appropriate headroom in our Solvency surplus to act as a buffer when required
   0.00  1 In Asia, our growing base of recurring premium business means we start each year with a clear earnings base, which compounds with each subsequent year of new regular premium business
   0.00  1 As I have already highlighted, our strategic emphasis on health and protection is also increasing the proportion of earnings derived from insurance income, another indicator that our growth is a high-quality growth
   0.00  1 Across each of our businesses, these key drivers are growing well
   0.00  1 It validates the quality of our U.K
   0.00  1 annuity portfolio and is another example of our ability to execute well
   0.00 -1 Credit risk is the larger component of this where we have reduced credit exposure for U.K
  -0.25  0 PAC on a Solvency II basis by around 30%
   0.05  0 On completion of the Part VII transfer, we estimate that the sale will lead to a $1.3 billion reduction in the SCR and a 0.2 billion -- sorry, and a GBP 0.2 billion decrease in own funds, resulting in an increase in PAC's capital surplus of GBP 1.1 billion
   0.17  0 The capital benefit from the sale will be retained to support the U.K
   0.00  1 regulated insurance entity on an extremely solid capital footing at the outset of the demerger with a pro forma cover ratio of 150% as if it was all completed at the 2017 year-end, including the transfer of Hong Kong subsidiaries
   0.00  1 This provides us with maximum flexibility as we work to optimize the capital structures of both entities prior to separation
   0.06  0 Going forward, your estimates for M&G Prudential's IFRS profits should recognize that the annuity portfolio being sold contributed approximately GBP 140 million to the 2017 U.K
   0.25  0 core life operating profit of GBP 597 million
   0.00  1 This transaction is a significant milestone for M&G Prudential as it continues to transition towards a de-risked business model and an appropriate balance of risk exposures
   0.11  0 Now it would be remiss of me not to share with you some of the high-level steps we will be taking to effect the demerger of M&G Prudential
  -0.04  0 Although many activities and actions will run concurrently, as you'd expect, the exact timing of each will be the subject of various factors, including regulatory approvals, the Part VII [ transfer ] process, and for the debt management operations, suitable market conditions
   0.07  0 operating companies and the realignment of the group's debt capital position across the Prudential plc and M&G Prudential entities
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 So in summary, again, strong growth in Asia, the balance of the business, the U.S
   0.00  1 has a strong performance underlying the rationale for creating a simpler, more focused strategy there
  -0.18  0 So what I'd like to do, if we could, is invite my colleagues up to join me for the Q&A, and then we will address any individual concerns you have or questions you have in just a moment
   0.20  0    Can we get the mic working, please, for Jon?  Jon Hocking of Morgan Stanley
  -0.17  0 I assume you're going to be trying to get out of the Solvency II framework
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.25  0 Second question, just looking at Jackson's capital
  -0.33  0 And then a final question, just on China
  -0.25  0 The regulatory environment seems to be quite fluid
  -0.12  0 And the -- where the other jurisdictions recognize Solvency II, their primacy is they're on regulatory regime and how we treat it
   0.08  0 So we probably could bring some of them down closer to regulatory, but if you want a long-term -- if you want a 90-year position to the market, they have to see you as committed and not as a foreign player that comes in and strips as much as they can out every year
  -0.10  1 So there're a lot of reasons to maintain well-capitalized firms on the local basis, and then those roll up to Solvency II
  -0.10  0 We never said -- as we've discussed and was debated earlier on, remember dividend policy of Solvency II
  -0.11  1 There is a -- so the intent is to maintain a very well-capitalized international business with capital levels that rival anyone that we -- anyone we compete with
  -0.17  1 We'll maintain well-capitalized businesses, heavy liquidity
  -0.20  0 Did you want to add anything to that?  The obvious point is that we're going to continue to be subject to Solvency II until the point of demerger
   0.17  0 And then over the course of that period, as we discussed with the regulators in terms of what the new capital position and capital model will be, we'll then be in a position to communicate that through
  -0.09  0 We think those 2 are best put together because there are interactions between their view on long-term default rates and the taxation and recoveries that come through there
   0.00  1 That said, I think everything we've seen suggests that we -- we're generating capital
  -0.50  0 So hope that answers your question
   0.00  1 I mean, look, we see this as the outworking of the decree, if you like, at the October Party Congress, which is -- which set effectively the objective for the industry to return to its core
   0.20  0 So now -- I mean, you've heard me talk about the opportunity, I can put some more numbers on that now
   0.00  1 So that's yet another indication of growth
   0.00  1 Again, in the EU, asset management, retail asset management is 75% of GDP, so sixfold increase
   0.00  1 I think we continue to broaden on the life side our footprint and to grow into that
   0.14  0 And that's -- that has a compounding effect on the numbers -- on the financials of our business
   0.00  1 As we expanded our presence in the Hunan Province, which is an important province because it's got 94 million people and it's the fifth-largest economy in China
   0.00  1 We've increased the recruitment rate by 48% since last year
   0.00  1 And the sales are increasing at 46% on the agency side
   0.00  1 On the banking side, we're increasing even faster at 51% as we leverage more the 4,000 strong branch network that we have across -- that we distribute across our business
   0.00  1 On the quality side, we're building the health and protection piece very fast
  -0.17  0 A lot of work on claims, 99% are processed digitally
   0.14  0 And it's important in a country like China, given the importance, given that it is leading the digital economy
   0.10  0 So unless you are kind of highly automated and digitized in this market, then this business is pretty much leading the way within our portfolio
  -0.50  0 Thank you for your question
  -0.25  0 I've got three questions on China
  -1.00  0 I do have three questions, though
  -0.07  0 And secondly, if those annuity -- future annuity transactions do take place anything like the one you've just announced, would that imply that excess capital would build up in the U.K
  -0.12  0 Maybe too early to talk about that, but the main point is, would there be excess capital emerging in the U.K
   0.00  1 And I'm very proud of the team for doing it
   0.00  1 We will evaluate it, what's best for shareholders, what's best for our business in the longer term
  -0.29  0 And then if it's excess, it's excess, and we'd look at distributing as we always would
   0.14  0 That said, we're in a position right now where stat reserves are floored out
  -0.05  0 So we get a little bit of an asymmetric dynamic going right now in terms of no real offset for -- no economic offset going on in the stat reserves for the hedges that are coming through, which has tended to drag, call it, GBP 300 million right now, run rate
  -0.20  0 Secondly, within the solvency ratio of the U.K
  -0.20  0 We've broken the book into various cohorts if you like
   0.14  0 And they have been sold all to one counterparty, but they could have been sold in different blocks to different people and they will attract different prices
   0.25  0 The other thing is that it depends on the market as well at the time
   0.12  0 We will be able to share with you in the future, in due course more information about what that capital structure will look like
  -1.00  0 Two questions
  -0.50  0 The second question -- well, that was a 2-part one
  -0.05  0 The second question is like Old Mutual heavily incentivized their management to do the separation, I think cumulatively, this year, got GBP 9 million or something like that, well this year [indiscernible]?  Can you show me that later?    Are you going to modify your ultimate schemes in any way for the separation because..
  -0.50  0  Last question, sorry
  -0.17  0 So we've never disclosed the -- I think most of the bank transactions have confidential agreements per annum
  -0.08  0 Although, you can see from -- there are the metrics on here, our expectations on the back book and the percentage of recurring earnings, which I think gets you a lot of the way to your question from the materials we have distributed
  -0.25  0 And as cited before, with some of the key things, I suspect the main one is the Hong Kong transfer of ownership
  -0.07  0 So if you can maybe talk a bit about that and how material it could be for you?  So you're correct, the long work stream in the project is -- the transfer in Hong Kong is actually -- we've discussed that with all key stakeholders
   0.00 -1 We're not surprising anyone with this
   0.14  0 We're not -- we've effectively pre-cleared the activity with all the key regulators
  -0.09  0 So again, we're quite responsible for following their processes, but we think that's a work stream, not an approval issue
   0.17  0 It is dependent on PRA bandwidth and court bandwidth
   0.00  1 The PRA, we have a good relationship with
   0.00 -1 But we are getting into a different space, and I think we have to be conservative in our estimates there
   0.00  1 So that's got a good 9-month plus window to it, too
   0.20  0 But it's work- dependent, not an ambition calendar-wise
  -0.50  0 Your other question?    The quiz in Hong Kong
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.20  0  Well, it's a -- it's too early to draw any definitive conclusions
  -0.11  0 And of course, their level of a liquidity premium that they included in the quiz may well -- or matching adjustment for one to another expression may well change
  -0.06  1 But as to your point, whenever we've moved to a more risk-based regime in any parts of Asia, given the nature of what we do, which is a regular premium with a very heavy health and protection content, then we see that providing tailwinds
  -0.10  1 We saw that in China as moved to [indiscernible] with our solvency level increasing from in the -- to kind of 150, 160, 170s to the high 200s to 90% at the end of 2017
  -0.07  0 Presuming all the debt stays in the remaining plc business, which is no longer under Solvency II, so presuming any future debt you raised post the demerger will be senior debt
  -0.50  0 And the third question is on Malaysia
  -0.33  0 And the last question within the U.S
  -0.33  0    So in terms of the first two debt questions
   0.07  0 Andy, I'm not really in a position to say much more than we've said in our release in terms of the debt because we want to be able to have a conversation with everybody, we want to be able to have a conversation in the market in terms of what we do and how it is that we're going to do it
  -0.14  0 We haven't had any conversation yet in terms of the regulators in terms of what we might do around grandfathering Solvency II components
  -0.14  0 And therefore -- and that would also be the answer to the question in terms of the future debt and the senior debt
   0.00 -1 We're not unique in doing that
   0.00  1 And whatever happens in relation to the level of ownership that we would have, we'll remain very focused on driving value for you, our shareholders
   0.00  1  A sizable population, 2.8% penetration on the insurance side is predicted to increase to 3.9% by 2025
   0.00  1 This is -- both sides are likely to grow
   0.00  1 And we have a good presence
   0.00  1 It's growing its sales
   0.00  1 It grew its sales last year by 26%
   0.00  1 It's growing its market share
  -0.11  1 It's well balanced by reference to both product sets and distribution, growing its distribution force and doing more through the 4,000-or-so ICICI branches
   0.00  1 So very strong distribution platform
  -0.07  0 So the question is out from an earnings point of view, from a capability point of view, from a products distribution, how do we want to do that, not do we think this is the best share price for the Lifeco or -- and again, there're restrictions in what we can and can't do there
  -0.33  0 I've just got one question
  -0.12  0 It's not a single -- that was not the reason that we're -- sole reason we're divesting
   0.00  1 It's a more cash-centric earnings, which is a good thing, given it's the U.K
   0.12  0 And the market is more mature, so the earnings characteristics of stability, currency, things -- they have a different appeal
   0.00 -1 The best part of the decision was there was nothing to solve for, and probably the most difficult part
  -0.33  0 So there isn't anything broken
  -0.17  0 That's -- I've seen that argument dozens of times
  -0.33  0 So this isn't a good bank, bad bank
   0.00  1 This is two good businesses
   0.00  1 And we think that's -- from a stewardship point of view, the right time to make that call
   0.00  1 And so there's capabilities
   0.00  1 If -- even in some of the -- we have a few markets in Asia where there's pretty robust retirement plans from the government
  -0.33  0 And again, you asked a question about diversifying Jackson
   0.00  1 and Europe and also very large players in Asia who are looking to expand their scale in the Asian market and looking for good quality franchises
   0.05  0 So can you talk to us a little bit about the thought processes around were one of those companies to approach, how you would think about that as an eventual outcome, given the demerger that's currently going on, please? And the second one is on the PRU, M&G PRU go-forward strategy
   0.11  0 I was just wondering if you could comment about whether there's any ambitions to expand product or distribution capabilities, please
  -0.20  0 And the third one was just -- not to put that -- belabor the debts questions but maybe -- what would be quite hopeful I suppose is to understand the leverage capacity
   0.17  0 But could you just please remind us what the IFRS equity for the U.K
   0.33  0 entity is, please?  Okay
  -0.33  0 So the housekeeper sort of question
   0.12 -1 And so the -- is there any greater risk of PRU plc being acquired with or without M&G PRU
  -0.06  0 I don't think the additional value of PRU, M&G PRU -- of M&G PRU and their model would have made that big a difference in their question
  -0.17  0 And the ones that -- I think Canton aren't known for doing hostiles
   0.00  1 It is always incumbent on us as a management team to demonstrate we're the best stewards of the business
   0.00  1 All those things are -- the things that make you attractive also would be their defense
  -0.10  0 At the end of the day, it would be the board's decision if someone came with an obscene amount of money for the business, then that's something that the board obviously has to consider
   0.00  1 But it is by no means -- you could back into the likelihood of it, I think we can -- I think these businesses are competitive
  -0.50  0 So we don't lack
   0.00  1 And I honestly -- from a personal point of view, I think it's one of the more -- it's one of the things I've learned in this role
   0.00  1 It's one of the more fascinating looks at the business because it's very much about -- because they have to front load so much of their work and they tie up bandwidth much more than it is to us, and it's a very interesting sort of affirmation of how we are as a business
    nan -1 We have to be good enough
   0.00  1 But I think you'll see us over time, you'll see more partnerships laterally and things that are different than the model now because we can and because to them, they see us as a good business prospect for their long-term plans
   0.00  1 They're -- people are bringing us their newest and best stuff
  -0.67  0 But no, so I don't worry about a hostile
   0.17  0 And we'll continue those -- diligently on those work streams as well
   0.00  1  So the go-forward strategy -- thanks for the question, I feel a Nic type answer coming on because I think it's a -- we've really got a big opportunity here
   0.20  0 I mean, Mark put up a slide earlier on about how we see the opportunity
   0.00 -1 The issue I think we have right now is twofold
   0.00  1 We've got 36% increase in PruFund
  -0.25  1 I mean, the range of what we have that the market is interested in is quite compelling
   0.00  1 And I think bringing the two businesses closer together will help accelerate that
  -0.50  0  And then the debt question
   0.20  0  And Ravi, in terms of the IFRS equity position
  -1.00  0 I just -- two questions, if I can
  -0.25  0 How do you see that space evolving?  So on Solvency II
   0.14  0 No, I think it depends on, I mean -- I'll let Mark comment on this as well
   0.17  0 It depends on what the nature of the liabilities are and what the nature of the capital is
  -0.25  1 So it's got a new source of liquid earnings, liquid capital generation
   0.00  1 But if you said to me, is that a strong number for that firm given the liabilities it has, the -- what its capital structure looks like and what its earnings prospects look like to generate capital, I think it's a healthy number
  -0.17  0 I don't know, do you want to disagree with me now publicly?  I'd never do that
  -0.14  1 So the risk profile of the business is significantly reduced, significantly less volatile
  -0.09  0 When you're in the -- if you're in the U.K., the PAC Board meeting, the first lens really is Solvency II, has gotten its -- and the second lens is own risk appetite
   0.00 -1 So if you do reduce the risk, the amount of capital you're holding theoretically should come down
  -0.11  0 Again, subject to market norms and all of the regulatory and everything else, the more risks you're taking, obviously the higher it should be
   0.00  1 But it'll be well capitalized, and everyone will -- we'll have the agreement we need on that from key stakeholders before we let it go
   0.00  1 Asian distribution?  Clearly, we are alive to the trends
   0.00  1 Where we have seen digital distribution gaining traction has been predominantly in the P&C space and kind of very simple low-case size kind of in the health space
  -0.25  0 Whenever it's come to high-case size or something more complicated and when you're in Hong Kong, you're talking about critical illness products that cover about 113 or so different conditions
   0.00 -1 Whenever you've seen it increase in complexity, then they don't get a lot of traction
   0.14  0 I think the winning strategies ultimately will be ones that combine both online and offline
   0.07  0 And there are many examples that I can give you pretty much across all our businesses to equip our agents, to equip the people that sell our products in their branches in a way that enables them to do it as digitally as possible, and fulfill ultimately what the customer wants
  -0.20  0 And a lot of it is ease-of-use, not necessarily purchasing
  -0.20  0 Just a couple of questions on the U.S
   0.00  1 And Mike, I was very intrigued by your comment that policyholders are making very good investment returns from their variable annuity assets, which I'm sure   is true
   0.00 -1 And I just wondered what your thinking was on why that is happening
  -0.14  0 And you know the guarantees are sub-5, right? The withdrawal of guarantee after their money is depleted
  -0.04  0 So if you and I created a variable annuity company today that entered the market, right, and we sold a contract today at this S&P level, assuming they only buy the Index One, they can buy an Index One, we have the same -- we would be the same pricing point as Jackson will be with the client renewing today on the guarantee fee
   0.09  0 And as we've said, we're not trying to make money on the guarantee fees, but it's plenty to hedge the equity exposure
  -0.50  0 So no, there's no intention
   0.00 -1 It's still nowhere near our pricing assumptions
   0.00 -1 consumers, they're fairly cautious with retirement money
   0.20  0 So I mean, the net amount of risk is probably the least favorite
  -0.17  0 It's something that others disclose, so we've made disclosures in the past
  -0.12  1 And even if you look at the net amount of risk, which is a flawed number, you'll see it's good as it's been over the years as well
  -0.06  1 In terms of -- it's -- the markets may look frothy from the equity side, interest rates backing up are actually quite helpful in terms of the overall value of the guarantees, so that's a good indicator
  -0.25  0 If you want to call it that, then we'll go to -- break for dinner
  -1.00  0 Just a quick question
  -0.07  0 We don't have -- I think M&G and PRU would tell you that however motivating visits are from JHO to their business units, they're not critical in the day-to-day operations in the current structure
   0.00 -1 You'd have heavy turnover
  -0.11  0 You know -- we find Asian investors have no problem buying shares on the FTSE, and they tend to gravitate towards our most liquid -- we're on Hong Kong, we're on Singapore, we have an ADR in the U.S
  -0.17  0 The larger investors tend to gravitate to the most liquid market which is here
   0.33  0 So we don't see any distinctive answers
   0.00  1 We like the talent
  -1.00  0 Just one question
   0.00  1 I recognize this is the best one
  -0.17  0 And it's a   -- but there is a question of -- we can manage -- if that process occurs, we can manage it
  -0.17  0 When you're in the marketplace, you're subject to market activity
  -0.25  0 And mean, I wouldn't diminish that that can happen
  -0.33  0  And final question?  Yes
  -0.25  0 Or should I be worried about your EEV assumptions?  So the $6 billion is the overall
  -0.22  0 And in terms of the -- could you -- would you mind repeating the second question?  It was the -- is the $300 million EEV loss a frictional cost of the demerger
   0.11  0 It's a result of the sale of the annuity book, which is something that we closed today and is effectively a core part of the derisking of the U.K
   0.00  1 business
   0.00  1 Thank you for your patience and attention through a very long session and your support through the year
  -0.17  0 We hope to see you all there, and we'll see -- if you have any questions, just follow up with our team, and we'll be back in touch
   0.00  1 Thank you

---FILE: Reckitt Benckiser Group plc.txt

   0.00  1                                                  Right, good morning
  -0.14  0 So first to draw your attention to the usual disclaimer about forward-looking statements, nothing new there
  -0.07  0 We're going to spend the first 45 minutes talking about the past and then go to some Q&A, then we'll take a quick comfort break and then go on to talk about the future, and then we'll do Q&A after that as well
   0.00  1 The first one is that, in a tough year, we had a solid close to the year
   0.00  1 And the third message that I have for you is that the Mead Johnson acquisition is not going to only prove to be a good acquisition for RB and its shareholders, it has been a catalyst to transform RB into what we call inside the company RB 2.0
   0.00  1 Q4 was, I would say, or the strong -- or solid finish to the year with plus 2%
   0.00  1 And I see what was good about Q4 was that we had our growth, once again, Health and Hygiene led
   0.00  1 Health had plus 5%, Hygiene was plus 2%
  -0.11  0 And as we will explain later in the day, the growth on Health was quite broad based and across the portfolio
  -1.00  1 So that was quite good
   0.00 -1 We sort of reversed 9 previous quarters of no growth
   0.00 -1 I know we flagged that the incoming margins of Mead Johnson was somewhat lower than we were expecting, although the top line was in line with our expectation at that time, but we worked really hard in the second half to bring those margins into a shape that we believe will all go well for the future
  -0.11  1 And finally, the cash conversion remains strong, and subject to shareholder approval, our board will be recommending a total dividend of plus 7% for this year
   0.11  0 Now no presentation from mine will be without pointing out to the virtuous earning model, and I will talk about it even though it looks less than perfect in 2017
   0.00 -1 A number of things we continue to do, but on the other side, obviously, in a tough year, bonuses don't -- do not normally pay out and that also helps a bit, something that we don't want to see actually going forward because we want to perform
   0.00  1 In terms of BEI, I mean, although the track record over a number of years is very good, but as I flagged last time, same time, we will be taking away some of the investment support behind Scholl because of what we had said before
    nan  1 So that has also been a good thing
   0.00  1 Operating margins on the base business grew by 30 basis points to 28.1%
   0.00  1 And I said that Mead Johnson for us is very strategically compelling
   0.00  1 It makes a lot of sense because it augments and -- our consumer health focus and expertise
   0.00  1 And finally, we said we want to, of course, make strong value creation for shareholders
   0.00  1 It allowed us to work on the synergies faster, understand the business faster, get to work on the synergies faster and help us realize the margin ambition that we have for the business
   0.00  1 But equally, it helped us understand the business to a point that we expect now synergies to touch $300 million in the next 3 years
   0.00  1 So that's been one key part of having the deal done faster
   0.00  1 The second part is knowing the business earlier and helping us make hit the catalyst for RB 2.0, as I just flagged
   0.22 -1 It is eventually a game where innovation has to be increased, and we knew that innovation track record was not the way we want it to be
  -0.08  0 And that's quite important because when I show you what that [ model ] has looked like over the last 6 years or so, this is the start of the, let's call it, the consumer health focus
   0.00  1 We grew gross margins 500 basis points up
   0.00  1 We obviously got fixed cost leverage
   0.00  1 We grew our operating margins by 500 basis points
   0.17  0 Richard, we put this beautiful air freshener that I'm going to talk about so close to me
   0.00  1 It's nice
   0.33  0 This is what Nurofen has achieved, a brand of that stature
   0.00 -1 Durex, I cannot remember a year where it did not have high single-digit or double-digit growth rates
   0.10  0 We don't -- we -- all the growth that we build in is based on where the brands are in the geographies they are in and how we can drive them with innovation and with our go-to- market expertise
  -0.08  0 So let's see whether some of those assumptions have proved to be right or wrong because I think this is an important time to be absolutely open about what has happened
   0.00  1 This is the growth of this category
   0.11  0 One of the hottest trends right now in VMS is products and innovations focused on millennials
   0.00  1 And you can see already that these guys, this demographic is making up a material part of the market now and growing the category very well
   0.15  0 So the innovation, the first thing we learned is that the innovation track we have to put these brands into is materially different to what you have to need in Health, Hygiene and Home in the conventional sense
   0.33  0 So the innovation track record that we put in place and the pace of innovation and the way we manage innovation is materially different
   0.18  0 And that's what we learned actually, that you want to manage innovation, you want to grow this category, you have to innovate differently, and that's what we are doing
   0.00  1 We have done always a very, very good job on synergies, and in fact, today, this morning, I gave you an example of that
   0.00  1 I mean, I was -- I felt very good actually, I have to say that
   0.00  1 Felt really good
   0.00 -1 It didn't work
   0.00  1 And I have to say that was a good lesson, very, very good lesson in how do we actually manage international expansion
    nan  1 But we did well
   0.00  1 We learned and we did well
  -0.14  0 It's no different to what we have done in January 2012 when I shut shop on private label
  -0.33  0 So we shut basically private label
   0.00  1 And in the years of our ownership, that branded business that I showed you grew on a compounded annual growth rate of 9%
   0.00  1 I think you thought that we haven't done well enough, but actually, we did very well
    nan  1 We did very well
   0.00 -1 From the time we bought this business, the gross margins were way below the company average, way below
   0.00  1 Now the gross margins of this group of brands that I just showed you, which are the business, is accretive to the company
   0.00  1 My company margins, they're accretive to company margins
  -0.09  0 Well, I don't have to tell you when the top line is there, and the gross margin, this question doesn't really need to be asked
   0.00  1 I'm absolutely thrilled that we have this business
   0.00  1 And it has created value for shareholders, even though we are still not 100% globalized these brands
  -0.05  0 So I think when I look back and I know that this question got asked a couple of times on the road and I keep hearing from my people, why didn't you ever address Schiff because people keep thinking the way you don't talk about it, this must be not a good enough thing to talk about
  -0.06  0 Actually, I said something which I'm going to repeat today: I said we haven't been able to transform the VMS market, and therefore, on the high bar we set ourselves, on the high expectation we have, no, we have not fulfilled
   0.00  1 What we have fulfilled is 5 years of ownership, as shown that we can create value, and this is a very interesting category
  -0.14  0 And it is quite interesting that we are here 5 years later talking about Schiff and how it's done
   0.00  1   So thank you, Rakesh, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen
  -0.18  0 The discontinued net income row includes the results of the Food business prior to its disposal, the gain on that disposal and the provision made in half 1 in respect of the demerged Indivior business
  -0.25  0 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
  -0.09  0 This comprises a noncash release of deferred tax in respect of the substantial intangible assets held in U.S
   0.08  0 entities and the charge of around GBP 200 million in respect of tax on principally Mead Johnson accumulated undistributed profit outside the U.S.A
   0.00  1 Growth in total adjusted earnings per share in the full year was 7%
   0.00  1 This has, of course, several components: continuing adjusted earnings per share growth was 10%
  -0.17  0 Dilution from the disposal of the Food business accounts for this difference
   0.00 -1 The increase in the underlying tax rate reduced earnings per share by 2%
  -0.33  0 deferred tax reduction
   0.20 -1 This headwind will be strongest at the start of the year with a Q1 headwind of around 10%
   0.08  0 This slide shows the RB -- shows the summary of RB base numbers and the Mead Johnson numbers in pro forma format down to operating profit
  -0.17  0 The RB base numbers do not include Food as this is now treated as a discontinued item
   0.11  0 We include them in this format as we believe they help inform investors on the shape of the business
   0.00  1 On this pro forma basis, the like-for-like net revenue of the combined group increased 1% in half 2
   0.00 -1 Gross margin decreased by 90 basis points and operating margin by 30 basis points
   0.00  1 As we have just seen, revenue for Q4 was GBP 2.58 billion, a like-for-like increase of 2%
  -0.10  0 We have set out an analysis of the impact of currency movements and disposals in the appendices to this presentation, and of course, in the release
   0.00  1 Together, these delivered a 40 basis point increase in operating margin
   0.00  1 The more analytical among you might be asking yourself how a 50 basis point increase in operating margin in half 1 plus a 40 basis points increase in half 2 delivers a 30 basis points increase in the full year
  -0.20  0 The answer is, in large part, the Brexit sterling devaluation in mid-2016
  -0.11  1 Firstly, on price and volume changes for the RB base business, the 2% growth for Q4 comprised a return to volume growth at 3% after the disruptions of the last quarter and a continuation of the decline in price mix seen in Q3 at minus 1%
   0.00  1 ENA sales grew by 1% in Q4
  -0.09  1 The sales growth in North America of 2% benefited only slightly from an increase in the incidence of cold and flu towards the end of the quarter as there was a lag in customer reordering
   0.00 -1 The impact of private label competition on the Mucinex brand was also slightly lower than expected, it appears, due to some supply issues
   0.00  1 Sales in the rest of ENA grew by 1%
  -0.17  1 Growth in Russia, Germany and Italy was strong as a result of good [ in ] market performance and in part also weaker sales last year
   0.00 -1 Across ENA, the structural pressures on many modern trade customers continued to be evident
   0.00  1 The -- and growth in e-commerce channels continue to build
   0.00  1 Thank you, Richard, nice aroma
   0.00 -1  I think we have to love our brand a little bit more
  -0.20  0 Growth in these markets was, however, offset by declines in the Middle East and in Brazil
   0.00  1   We expect the stronger China and India but also the weaker Middle East and Brazil dynamics to continue into the current year
  -0.17  1 Revenue increased by 5% in Q4 after 4 quarters of declining or flat revenue
   0.00  1 Mucinex, Nurofen, Strepsils, Durex all performed well
   0.00  1 For the full year, all health Powerbrands except Scholl, that is Durex, Gaviscon, Mucinex, Nurofen, Strepsils and the Schiff VMS portfolio, all grew
   0.00  1 And the total Health portfolio, excluding Scholl, grew in the middle of our view of the 4% to 6% medium-term market range, notwithstanding the supply issues in the middle of the year
   0.00  1 In Hygiene, we delivered 2% growth in Q4, 1% for the full year
  -0.09  1 The strong growth in India increased growth in this category but was offset by the weakness in the Middle East and Brazil, both of which are markets with a strong orientation to Hygiene products
   0.00 -1 Portfolio sales were down 15% in Q4 and down 9% for the full year
  -0.33  0 They are, of course, now really quite small
   0.00 -1 BEI spend was lower by 10 basis points in half 2 and by 20 basis points in the full year
  -0.14  0 We remain broadly content with the level of BEI as a proportion of revenue
   0.00  1 Other SG&A costs decreased by 70 basis points
   0.00 -1 Within ENA, we saw modest margin reduction, a 50 basis points decrease in half 2
   0.17  0 This was more than offset by reductions in SG&A, including the GST effect
   0.00  1   As you have seen, revenue for Q4 was GBP 709 million, a like-for-like increase of 3%
   0.00  1 Revenue for half 2 was GBP 1.43 billion, a like-for-like increase of 2%
   0.00 -1 Gross margin in half 2 reduced by 270 basis points
   0.20  0 Adjusted operating profit in the half was GBP 310 million
   0.00 -1 This was a 21.7% margin, a 270 basis points reduction on the comparative period
   0.00 -1 This margin is lower than we had expected at this stage when we announced the acquisition in February last year
   0.00 -1 As you know, we had expected a fall in margin in half 1 prior to the closing of the transaction, but not one as large as the 500 basis points fall that occurred
  -0.11  1 First, on their price and volume, the 3% growth in Q4 revenue comprised a volume decline of 1% and a price mix increase of 4%
   0.00  1 We saw volume growth in China but not yet in the other main geographies
   0.17  0 Within Greater China, the 4 drivers we described in February -- in last February and saw in the Q3 numbers continue to play through
   0.00  1 In addition, market growth has increased, a combination of volume from the increase in births and a continued desire on the part of Chinese mothers to seek the best available product for their babies
   1.00 -1 Within Southeast Asia, progress has been less encouraging to date
   0.00  1 There have been market and operational challenges as well as good progress in some areas
   0.00 -1 The headwinds from the large WIC renewal in California in midyear at a materially higher discount and some other WIC changes will continue until mid this year
   0.00  1 Canada performed very well
  -0.33  1 Within LatAm, growth was quite strong in the quarter
   0.00 -1 The channel and sourcing shift in China, described when we announced the acquisition, have continued to involve material margin dilution
   0.00 -1 We expect the China channel shift and dairy pricing -- dairy price pressures to decrease as we move through 2018
   0.09  0 It reflects annualizing a heavy period of spend in MJN and it reflects an increased focus on efficiency, which we are together bringing
   0.00  1 This program is very firmly on track
   0.00  1 We delivered the savings we expected to deliver in 2017 while IFCN was a stand- alone division, about $25 million
   0.00  1 The model is very much intact
   0.00 -1 Specifically, we are at present seeing some commodity cost headwinds
   0.07 -1 We do not expect these to improve materially in aggregate in the short term, notwithstanding the comments specifically on dairy costs a couple of moments ago
   0.00 -1 And we are also in the face of tougher price pressure with our established retail customers facing substantial structural change
   0.00 -1 We absolutely do not see this as a long-term pressure, but we also do not see it going away in the very short term
   0.11 -1 We do not expect our internal efficiency programs to be able to offset fully these commodity cost and price pressures in 2018
   0.15  0 Secondly, looking at the effect on margins from the Mead Johnson acquisition and the creation of the 2 business units, we have a full year effect from consolidating the lower margin Mead Johnson business
   0.00 -1 Incorporating a roughly 20% margin run rate, Mead Johnson reduced group margin by 100 basis points in 2017 before cost synergies, and there will be a 70 basis points reduction before cost synergies in 2018
   0.00  1 We have also, of course, cost synergies from the Mead Johnson acquisition
   0.00  1 We expect to deliver cost synergies ahead of the targets we set out on the announcement, both in 2018 as well as in aggregate
   0.00  1 We expect the Mead Johnson cost synergies in 2018 to exceed slightly the cost dissynergies from the creation of the business unit structure, which we referred to at Q3
   0.11  0 Turning to the next slide and a summary of the group's net working capital position
   0.00 -1 We saw some pressures in receivable levels with days receivables, in some cases, being exchanged for changes in ordering patterns and other logistical arrangements, which reduce costs with our customers
  -0.14  0   Period-end numbers are, of course, a point in time and subject to some variation
   0.00 -1 This was below 100% due largely to the exceptional cash spend
   0.00  1 As signaled previously, we do expect it to increase from the about 2% level we have seen within RB in the past, and we expect it to be around 3% in 2018
  -0.17  0 Turning then briefly to the next slide on the subject of debt
   0.17  0 We are happy with the maturity profile and the 1/3 floating, 2/3 fixed balance of the debt
   0.17  0 We will show revenue-adjusted operating profit and so on for these units
   0.08  0 We will also show for the group as a whole revenue by geography, distinguishing North America, the rest of ENA or developed markets, Greater China and the rest of developing markets
   0.09  0 We plan to include with the Q1 trading update a similar analysis of 2017 adjusted operating profit by business unit
   0.00  1 We hope that this helps you with the development of your models in line with our future reporting
    nan  1 Very good
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions, if I may
   0.04 -1 Could you -- would you be able to quantify what has happened to value ideally across your different categories and give an indication of how important do you think that is for the virtuous business model?  Listen, I think it's very easy to look at what happened in the last 18 months where, of course, we saw a series of challenges
   0.00 -1 I mean, I always thought that -- take cyber issues
   0.12  0 So I think we have spent a lot of time in the last, I would say, 6, 8 months in enhancing our detection and our speed of recovery
  -0.25  0 It was targeted at some -- as you've just probably read last week, Russia was accused of this
   0.33  0 I think we talked about innovation
   0.08  0 I think I am very open to talk about RB's learnings as much as I'm willing to talk about RB's strengths, if you want
   0.00  1 And I have to say that our track record on VMS has been very, very good
   0.00  1 So I -- all the challenges that you referred to are all actually about learning how to become a better company
  -0.20  0    Value price by category, I think, was the second part of the question
   0.00  1  Yes, would like to take that?  Okay, very good
  -0.10  0 And in fact, when you sort of decompose our numbers, we talk about -- and if you look through these one-offs that you're referring to, volume has actually been quite constant
   0.00 -1 And we called out both at Q3 and Q4 that we're seeing a 1% price mix headwind in our numbers
   0.00 -1 We believe principally as a result of the structural changes that are taking place in our channels, the big players are under a huge pressure and that shows -- the dynamic shows
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of questions
  -0.20  0 In your press release, you say that online sales in China are now about 50% of your Chinese revenues
   0.00 -1 I mean, this -- the shift to online is creating a lot of debate
   0.33  0 Is it achievable?  Yes, okay, cool
  -0.11  1 And I do believe that our march, our march, RB's march to e-commerce as a company is quite relentless and very top-down
   0.18  0 The #1 thing, if you ask me what we learned about VMS, is that and I, again, reflectively say that hardly any large company could do what we managed to achieve, which is to really change the way we innovate
   0.18  0 So I think the way we innovate on OTC, let's say, is very different to the way we innovate on Hygiene brands
   0.15  0 Actually, VMS is unlike these 2, and therefore, a company born and brought up, innovating in a certain way and knowing the difference between the 2, actually try to innovate it like these 2 or 1 of the 2
   0.22  0 But actually, the VMS innovation cycle, the way you go to drive it and how you get innovation is completely different
   0.20 -1 If you behave like a large company, which is most often the case, you cannot be successful in VMS
   0.10  0 But again, a more philosophical answer to -- or more answer borne by my learning actually in how to be successful in these 2 areas, both e-commerce as well as VMS
  -1.00  0 So 2 questions
   0.11  0 And then secondly, on the benefits of your new organization in terms of these innovation and agility you hope that's going to bring, can you talk about how you think that's going to start manifesting itself in the numbers you report sort of how quickly and some of the changes from that?  Yes
   0.00  1 But let me just say that when we bought Mead Johnson, we said that we expect this category, the infant nutrition category, to be growing at 3% to 5% in the medium term
   0.22  0 We said our ambition would be to progressively, progressively get to the top end of that curve, and that is what we stick to
   0.33 -1 But I have to say that you have to be confident to do things like what we did with Mead Johnson
   0.00  1 It's a good thing
  -0.07  0 I think as we said to you in our Q3 call and we are going to sort of restate what we said, that the markets that we compete in, and I'm not talking about every market that might exist in the world, the markets we compete in are growing at about 2%
   0.00 -1 And also, I think, Adrian, you mentioned that you think price pressures are considered to be only of short- term nature
   0.10  0 And they are behaving in ways which are the way they've always behaved but stronger, but on steroids, if you like, is the way they conduct their relationship with us and other manufacturers
   0.00 -1 But when you then step back and say, well, this is -- because this is clearly a structural change in that part of the market and the -- where you go from the manufacturer's warehouse through to the consumer's pantry, there are clearly enormous structural changes taking place in that
   0.00 -1 We don't see why
   0.00 -1 We don't see why
   0.14 -1 We talked about price pressure, didn't we, net profitability?  Yes
   0.18 -1 Well, one could get pretty esoteric here but price pressure that's leading to changes in -- for a while in the profitability between the components in the value chain essentially
  -0.04  0 I mean, it's the mechanism for -- that's the mechanism for shifting it, isn't it?  Listen, I would add a couple of points here, which is that I think if you look at the last couple of years, not only have we seen some of the dramatic changes in channel shifts and how some key people have responded, but I also think that this is also being typified by climate, which is quite benign from a commodity point of view
   0.00 -1 I think we expect to see a tougher commodity climate, and as a result of it, I'm not sure whether this type of pricing that has been in the market over the last 12 to 18 months can sustain
   0.00 -1 But I think if the commodity headwinds stay the way they -- we see it today
   0.00  1 We have had also benign commodity environment over 18, 24 months before
  -0.40  0 The last 2 questions have been about the future, so I think now is a good time to stop
  -0.33  0 We'll have a 10-minute break
   0.00  1 Thanks
  -0.20  0 [Break]    Second half, I'm going to basically talk to you about 2 things
   0.00  1 As I said, it is going to be a catalyst for RB
   0.14 -1 Second, we need to improve the operational rigor and performance because clearly, it was not going in the right way
   0.00  1 And I think the best of both actually in RB always starts with 1 thing, which is the culture
   0.33  0 So starts with achievement orientation
   0.43 -1 Achievement for us is not being happy with our VMS performance even when other people will think it's spectacular
   0.00  1 It's -- achievement is that, the high bar that we set ourselves
   0.00  1 Entrepreneurship is about being agile and nimble and doing things that take a long time for other companies to do
   0.00  1 That's very important
   0.25 -1 And partnership is this notion that we will only be successful when we work better with each other, both inside but also outside of the company
    nan  1 This is the very best
   0.00  1 But equally, we understood very quickly that when you are serving moms and babies, when you are actually dedicated to giving babies the best start in life, nourishing the best start in life, it comes with a huge responsibility
   0.00  1 I mean, this is the first new value I think we have brought to RB in the years that I have been there, and I have been there a very long period of time
   0.00  1 So I think this is a very important new thing that we are adding as a part of our best of both
   0.00 -1 Actually, not
   0.04  0 In this pack or now in this, you can actually put the scoop right here, which means as soon as you take the can out, you don't have to put, I'm calling them maybe messy hands and, therefore, you offer consumers a secure, hygienic, easy solution to make sure that they can feed the babies with the right quantity and the right way
  -0.12  0 The story of really figuring out what was not working, what was going wrong, put the right 4 Ps of rightsizing pricing
   0.00  1 So I think that's what really you bring the best of RB culture to improve and bring urgency, I would say, speed and actually make that happen
  -0.10  1 And I think this kind of urgency that we were able to bring to our Mead Johnson, let's say, colleagues and brands and businesses has been very, very good and very noticeable
   0.00  1 So the run rates are very good already on the D2C platform
   0.00  1 We had -- we doubled our 11/11 performance in just a few months of getting there
   0.00  1 So I think driving this channel mix, which has been an opportunity but also a challenge in Mead Johnson, is something we are addressing very fast   and very hard
   0.00  1 So I think that -- I can already see some big signs that, that will become a nice, interesting way of driving this business
   0.00 -1 And I think Adrian and I have both alluded to the fact that when we took over Mead Johnson, we found the op margins to be minus 500 basis points in the first half, lower than what we expected
   0.00 -1 We did expect operating margins to be lower
    nan -1 But they were lower than that
   0.00  1 And what we have done in the second half of the year is brought back to the right trend and trajectory the operating margin performance
  -0.07  0 And some of that, clearly, is going to play out in our growth model, which I have said, I think I did say it just before the break, that we expect medium-term trends on this category to be 3% to 5%
   0.00  1 So I think this has been, the 6.5 months or so, have been a good 6.5 months
  -0.17  1 But the trends are good, the momentum, we have -- we have created -- the urgency we've created is good
   0.06  0 And then you have brands in the area of nutrition to make you -- keep you healthy, whether it's the first 1,000 days with Enfamil or Nutramigen or just to keep you healthy, if you are -- if you need immunity, a boost of immunity or heart health or many of the other brands
   0.00 -1 Wellness, sexual wellness is an important issue for people
   0.20  0 I mean, I can give you a lot of stats about how many people are satisfied with their sex lives
   0.20  0 But how do we actually serve those people who want to have sexual happiness and wellness
  -0.50  0 You have a brown liquid, which is about -- it's an antiseptic liquid
   0.00 -1 You fall down, you get hurt, you don't want to have a septic, you don't want to have infection
  -0.20  0 But clearly, you can see it is quite a wide-stretched portfolio
  -0.25  1 The right-hand side looks quite materially changed
  -0.25  0 I mean, again, in our industry, to move from 65% to 85% or so is quite significant
   0.00 -1 So this has happened
  -0.13  1   But beyond this happening actually, what has also happened is that while we have done quite well, I have to say, quite well on the Health side, this is the sixth year compounded annual growth rate on the Health portfolio, 6 years
   0.00  1 So in the last 6 years or so, we've grown our Health business by a compounded annual growth rate of 7%
   1.00 -1 Not happy
   1.00 -1 Not happy
   0.00  1 And that's what RB 2.0 is all about, basically is to give 2 platforms with 2 business units, 2 accountable focused management teams to make sure we can execute very well
  -0.10  0 It's GBP 5 billion, it's quite large, and I would say that many companies do not have a GBP 5 billion Hygiene Home business
   0.00  1 That's what we've managed to create
   0.00 -1 There are economic reasons that are driving it
   0.00  1 So I do expect consumer health to be a strong, steady- growth category
  -0.08  0 Because somebody did ask me this question, what is your ambition on Hygiene Home? Now remember, we've grown on a compounded annual basis at 1% over the last 6 years
   0.00  1 So actually, a lot faster and earlier than we thought we could be or anyone thought we could be
   0.00 -1 So that has happened
   0.00  1 So that's very cool
  -0.10  0 And I think somebody asked me this question in the break and I think I'm going to talk about that, somebody asked me, "Are you not going to be more stressed in RB 2.0 because you have to be the CEO and the Head of Health?" And I will say, well, earlier I was the CEO and the head of the company, so it's the same actually, but maybe even   smaller because I have a fully dedicated accountable management teams which is looking after Hygiene Home
   0.50  0 And they are a bit more empowered than otherwise would have been
   0.00 -1 So I think I honestly say that October and December was a tough period from a work point of view
   0.25  0 Want to just take you through our innovation pipeline
   0.05  0 And I thought as a departure from the past, I should start the innovation pipeline with Hygiene Home and not from Health, maybe a sign of times to come, like why not start with Hygiene Home? So let's start with Finish
   0.00  1 The Powerball, a very cool -- it's a gel -- power gel, power cap
   0.00  1 So it's very good
   0.17  0 So that's what is happening and then progressively get into other part of the world
  -0.14  0 And what we are launching under Lysol with wipes and in trigger is a new product which has no harsh chemicals
   0.11  0 Body marks are a combination of built-up sweat, sebum that settles into your fabric and attracts actually dust and pollution
   0.00 -1 And very tough to remove with first time clean
   0.00  1 Your fabrics are safer, and therefore, with Vanish, you get what it stands for, amazing stain removal and yet safe
   0.50  0  Please buy it then
   0.00  1 It's good, we should not give everything away
   0.00  1 I think this thing that Adrian was hinting at is -- Adrian, this is going to do very well
   0.00  1 So -- and I know it because you don't like it because then -- if you don't like hair care products, I'm cool with it because it's going to do very well
   0.15  0 Actually, I have to say that the innovation rate on Air Wick has been dialed up despite, let's say, maybe not having the same kind of focus before
   0.09  0 But we have dialed up the innovation rate on Air Wick, and this one basically comes with multiple settings that you might be able to see and, therefore, you can customize your fragrance experience
   0.08  0 Let's talk about Enfa, and I did tell you that we have put a new innovation in the market, but I want to talk to you about the science first actually
   0.00  1 And there's a lot of things to admire about Mead Johnson
   0.00  1 in very fast -- with very fast speed as the first formula with DHA and MFGM
   0.00  1 business
  -0.12  0 Okay, moving from here to Scholl because I need to confront and take Scholl all the time because that's what we have always done
   0.00  1 Now let me give you the good news
  -0.25  0 Okay, because it has things like Light my fire and Be my sweet addiction
  -0.20  0 We know unwanted pregnancies are on the rise
  -0.20  0 We want to take care of that serious topic
   0.00 -1 And I think -- we   thought it was a crazy idea
   0.00  1 Did extraordinarily well
   0.13  0 And just to prove the point, on VMS, I want to talk to you about 2 VMS innovations, although I said that we are launching 4 products, 4 innovations in Move Free itself [ indiscernible ] this year, but this one is just one of them, and this is Move Free 2in1
   0.00  1 So it is really the first and the best-proven joint care product which is being launched in the U.S
   0.29  0 Moving on from here to Digestive Advantage, and here, we are launching an innovation which I think is also first
   0.00  1 It's not just a probiotic, which a number of people have, but it also has a prebiotic; and a prebiotic actually helps your probiotic feed
   0.14  0 So this is quite a different innovation -- yes, 100x it says there somewhere, 100x better prebiotics
   0.00  1 And I think this is also very interesting because, for the very first time, we have a Nurofen patch
  -0.12  0 And we know that some people, particularly those who suffer from chronic pain -- people, those who suffer from chronic pain, do not like to take systemic analgesics, don't want to pop pills day after day and, therefore, use topical products
   0.00 -1 The problem with topical products is sometimes, they're messy and not easy and they don't last long enough
   0.00  1 There was a lot of clinical work here, and this is going to be quite a breakthrough in terms of topical relief for 24 hours
   0.09  0 I think I'm going to -- I think, yes, I'm going to finish actually talking about health with not an innovation actually
   0.50  0 If you choose to call this not as an innovation
   0.00  1 Now as I said that Mucinex is the #1 OTC brand in North America, which is a phenomenal thing to do
   0.00 -1 It's too expensive
   0.50  0 Now this is a simple insight
   0.00  1 A lot less expensive but very, very right
   0.00  1 And I mean, I was there on the next morning actually, I was in America, and they were talking about all the commercials and which ones were good and which ones were not good
   0.12  0 [Presentation]  And I have to say that it's this type of brilliance and innovation that we want to see in this company
   0.12  0 It cost still a lot of money but achieved 4 weeks' worth of advertising with the number of social media and other engagements we got
   0.10  0 So if this is not innovation, then what is? So with that, I think I just want to come into the targets for 2018, which I think everyone has gone through, must've been probably the first thing you looked at
   0.11  0 And let's face it, our company, everyone in the company has target to achieve total revenue
   0.00  1 And then the operating margin guidance, as Adrian has elaborated rather exhaustively, I would say, is moderate margin expansion in the medium term
   0.33  0 And with that, I'm happy to take, and Adrian is happy to take the next round of Q&As
  -0.14  0 Yes, [ Stuart ], you want to go first?    I'd just like a question on your RB 2.0
   0.00  1 All I would comment to you is that we have been very disciplined in looking at M&A
   0.00  1 Now that's the criteria we've applied and for every major acquisition we've done so far, my lifetime and before, all these 3 things have been proven to be true
  -0.33  0 That shows that we -- not by accident, it is by discipline
   0.00  1 So I think we will be very disciplined in any future M&A that we may do at whatever point in time
   0.00  1 So I think that is a good thing about the platforms
   0.06  0 I mean, the other big 5 players seem to me to be sort of growing roughly 3%, so the inference is you're taking share both at the moment in OTC, but you're anticipating, depending on your assumption about the market, taking share going forward
  -0.12  0 Sexual health is consumer health, preventing AIDS and STIs is consumer health
   0.15  0 Because what happens is that you can have 1 big innovation or sets of innovations or switches or things that are actually which move markets materially higher in some area and could also be seasonality actually, by the way, could be seasonality and could be the other way around
  -0.14  0 And actually, I know we documented quite well the impact of Scholl probably in the release as well
  -0.20  1 But our health brands and portfolio has performed really quite well throughout the year and throughout before
  -0.33  0 Just a question on foot care
  -0.25  0 There is a core, what we call, core aid business, problem solutions business
  -0.17  0 You have corn, you have fungal nail and that kind of products, and we have a range for all those problem solution aid products
   0.12  0 You need -- sometimes people need insoles to improve their gait and the way they walk and sometimes a podiatrist would tell you that
   0.14  0 If I look at these distinct things, I would say the aid segment, aid segment is still an important segment for Scholl and an important one where greater education, both in -- to consumers and in-store, is an important reason
   0.00 -1 And one of the ways -- one of the reasons why is because your blood flow and circulation is not as good
   0.08  0 I know that some people -- some women actually in Japan sleep in compression hosiery because they want to see their swollen legs come back to normal and look better
   0.29  0 And then there's the third part, which has been, if you ask me, the greatest peak and trough, if you want to call it, the greatest delta in Scholl
   0.00  1 I see it as a very important brand
   0.33  0 And I feel as interested to do that as I was before despite the fact that some innovations will always not work as well
   0.33  0 I mean, I've just launched all these innovations
  -1.00  0 Three questions for me
  -0.50  0  So that's question one
  -0.33  0 So a couple of questions on that
   0.00 -1 All I would say is that the importance of Scholl gadgets is coming down over a period of time mathematically, and you know that
   0.00 -1 But today, as we sit, it's materially lower than what it used to be
   0.40  0 So therefore, the impact, if any, is going to be materially lower or better depending on how it is
   0.11  0 What happens typically is retailers buy, and then they prepare for a certain season depending on how they feel
   0.06  0 And that happens during the flu season, which starts maybe in October and finishes maybe in Feb or March, depending on -- and sometimes a bit later, but that's -- so I think order and reorder patterns decide whether or not you'll see it in your numbers
   0.00  1 But what he was alluding to was although there has been an impact in Q4 of that, it is not so material to actually call it out as a big factor because a lot of our health care brands did well
   0.14  0 Because the last thing I want in this year is for people to spend too much time inside the company; much better do it outside
   0.00  1 All I would say, it has been a good acquisition for shareholders
   0.00  1    And it's earning today more than its cost of capital
    nan  1 Good
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

---FILE: RELX PLC.txt

  -0.12  0 You will have seen we've had a pretty busy few months, so there is quite a lot today to talk through
   0.00  1 In sterling, adjusted earnings per share was up 12%, and in euros, up 5%
   0.00  1 And we're proposing a dividend increase of 10% in sterling and 6% in euros
   0.00  1 We believe that our dual listing no longer serves any purpose, and that this is a natural next step for RELX Group, removing unnecessary complexity and increasing transparency
  -0.07  0 For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no changes to the locations of RELX Group or its 4 business areas, and there'll be no impact on the economic interests of any shareholders in PLC or NV
  -0.09  0 Thirdly, you will, I'm sure, also all have noticed that since the year-end, we've announced the intention to acquire ThreatMetrix for GBP 580 million
   0.00  1 citizen, Group Finance Director of Ashtead Group and brings extensive board experience from both sides of the Atlantic
   0.00  1 She is proving to be a strong addition to our boards
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.05  0 Our overall financial performance was consistent with recent trends across our 4 key financial metrics: underlying revenue growth, underlying adjusted operating profit growth, adjusted earnings per share and return on invested capital
   0.00  1 In STM primary research, which represents just over half of the division's revenues when you include both subscription and transactional revenues, we continued to enhance customer value by building out broader content sets, more sophisticated analytics and evolving our technology platforms
  -0.07  0 The percentage of renewals that have been completed   as of today is the same as the average percentage by the middle of February over the past 5 years, and the built-in growth rates in the renewed contracts are also at the same level
   0.00  1 New sets of research subscriptions have started the year well ahead of mid-February 2017
  -0.07  1 In total, we now have well over 5,000 institutional customers globally that have contracts for a broad collection of subscription journals, a number that continued to increase by a few hundred institutions during 2017, in line with historical trends
   0.00  1 The number of articles that we published under a fee-for-article open access model continued to grow double digits, and our market share under this model has now doubled over the past 4 years
   0.00  1 Databases and tools, which represent just over 20% of Elsevier revenues, continued to drive growth in the mid to high single digits across market segments
   0.00 -1 Electronic reference, which represents just under 10%, had a mixed year
   0.00 -1 And print pharma promotion, which represent less than 5%, declined in line with historical trends after stronger 2016
   0.00  1 Risk & Business Analytics grew 8% and revenue growth remains strong across all key segments
  -0.14  1 The market environment returned to historical trends in the fourth quarter after having been not quite as favorable earlier in the year
   0.00  1 The government and health care segment, which represents less than 10% of division, continued to drive strong growth by developing more sophisticated analytics
   0.00  1 And Data Services, which represents just over 20% of divisional revenues, continues to drive strong growth across all industries through organic development
  -0.10  0 During 2017, we disposed of additional magazines and services assets, reducing print to less than 3% of the division's revenues
   0.00  1 Going forward, the fundamental growth drivers of Risk & Business Analytics remain strong
  -0.11  1 Overall, continued growth in online revenues was partially offset by further print declines
   0.00  1 and international markets with broader data sets and a continued expansion of early-stage legal analytics
   0.17  0 Legal customers' usage to Lexis Advance is now substantially complete
   0.00  1 Exhibitions' underlying revenue growth accelerated to 6%, up from 5% in the prior year
   0.17  0 We also completed 5 small acquisitions and piloted several data analytics opportunities
   0.00  1 Europe, which represents around 40% of revenues, continued to see good revenue growth
   0.00  1 The U.S., which represents around 20%, continued to see differentiated growth rates by industry sector
   0.00  1 Japan and China grew strongly
  -0.20  1 And while Brazil remained weak, most other markets continued to grow strongly
  -0.08  0 In addition to our organic development-driven growth strategy, we continue to reshape our portfolio through selective acquisitions and selective disposals
   0.00 -1 2017 was an unusually light acquisition year, with only 8 transactions completed for GBP 123 million
  -0.25  0 2017 was a more active disposal year with 17 transactions completed
   0.11  0 There is no change to our strategy, and we expect the simplification to be cost and profit neutral for RELX Group, both before and after tax
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 As Erik said, underlying revenue growth of 4% was maintained in 2017
   0.00  1 Growth in earnings per share at constant currencies was 7%, ahead of profit growth, reflecting a lower interest charge, a slightly lower effective tax rate and the impact of the share buyback program, all partly offset by a drag from disposals
    nan  1 Cash conversion was again strong at 96%
   0.00  1 The equalized full year dividends, up 10% for the PLC in sterling and up 6% for the NV in euros
  -0.08  1 4% underlying revenue growth gave us 2% constant currency growth, the result of disposals and acquisitions are cycling out, more than offsetting the contribution from acquisitions
   0.40  0 After portfolio effects, constant currency profit growth was 3%
   0.12 -1 Conversely, growth of the euro strength resulted in a slightly lower euro denominated EPS growth of 5% to EUR 0.923
   0.00 -1 Reported earnings per share were inflated by the exceptional tax credit I just talked about
   0.00  1 In terms of the business areas, you can see how all 4 areas contributed to the overall revenue performance, with the Risk & Business Analytics and Exhibitions continuing to deliver strong underlying growth
   0.00 -1 Cycling decreased Exhibitions' revenue growth by 6 percentage points
   0.00  1 With the pound weaker on average against both the dollar and the euro, currency movements boosted sterling-reported revenues in all 4 business areas by around 5%
   0.00 -1 With more disposal activity in 2017, portfolio effects were a drag on profit growth, most notably in Legal
   0.17  0 STM's margin was flat on a reported basis with underlying improvements offset by portfolio effects
   0.00  1 Risk margins are up 60 basis points, in that case, helped by portfolio changes
   0.12  0 I've highlighted the different currency effects as we've gone go through the results
   0.07  0 FX rates will, of course, move from today's levels, but sterling is currently stronger against the dollar by around 7% and broadly unchanged against the euro compared to its average level   in 2017
   0.08  0 dollars, and capital employed the average FX rates increased accordingly with the currency impact being similar to the impact on profits
   0.00  1 Capital conversion was again strong at 96%
   0.08  0 From year-end to year-end, currency translation effects were broadly neutral, leaving net debt almost unchanged at GBP 4.7 billion
   0.14  0 The adjusted ratio was in line with the prior year despite the prior year having been flattened by currency movements
   0.00  1 So continuing with the aim to maintain leverage in or around the 2.1 to 2.5x range that we've been in, we continue to have capacity for share buybacks
   0.14  0 There are 3 of these standards we're already adopting this year, albeit the effect of one of them, IFRS 9, will be trivial
   0.09  0 Whilst there's some cumulative balance sheet effect, there's only a small impact on the full year income statement
   0.14  0 Taking all the changes together, there is no impact on revenue or profit growth rates
   0.10  0 Full year operating profit is unchanged, but there is a small impact on interest, which flows through to adjusted earnings per share
  -0.08  0 In the appendices, you'll find tables setting out expected restated H1 and full year 2017 numbers, which will become the comparators when we start reporting on 2018 numbers in July
  -0.08  0 The simplification is subject to certain conditions, including approval by both RELX PLC shareholders with a 75% majority and RELX NV shareholders with a 50% majority
   0.17  0 court approval will be sought in Q3, with the merger becoming effective around September
   0.12  0 The table sets out the current position for PLC and NV shares and how that will change following the simplification
  -0.33  0 And with that, I think we're ready to go to questions
   0.00  1 And lastly, at Legal, with the drag from selling Martindale-Hubbell Associate, probably be less in 2018, could we expect more margin improvement year-on-year from Legal in '18 than '17?  Okay
  -0.05  0 So revenue recognition, just to be clear, and we won't talk about any individual customer across, but just to be clear how it works, apart from some December, January cost of judgment that we've always had to make, all revenue were recognized in STM in the full year comes from signed contracts with customers
  -0.11  0 For example, if a contract is commercially agreed but not formally signed during the year, then you have to exercise some judgment as you go through half year, in third quarter and so on
  -0.12  0 But for the full year, apart from those kind of issues, all the revenue recognized is from signed customer contracts
  -0.20  0 We will, of course, in 2018 be adopting IFRS 15, which is even more clear cut
  -0.20  0 And even during the year, you only recognize -- in IFRS 15, you only recognize revenue from signed contracts
  -0.50  0 So that will still be there in the year-on-year drag
  -0.20  0 If you look at the numbers for Legal though in 2017, you'll see it's not the only drag from disposal, we have disposal another -- we mentioned it in the release, some other print assets and some service businesses that's come out of there
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions for me
   0.12  0  So when I see our margins going forward, clearly it depends what comes into the portfolio or may get out of the portfolio
  -0.17  0 Sometimes we do sell relatively high margin, but low growth already declining bits of the portfolio
   1.00  0 So it will depend
   0.00  1 And it has been growing marginally faster than the core of the other business, of course, because they're from a lower base
   0.00  1 So on an overall basis, they're contributing well to the business and to the growth, and we see them continuing to grow
  -0.25  0 So I don't see that this would -- this is something that's limited in the short term
   0.00  1 And we think and we've seen that, that adds significant value to customer sets that we already serve
   0.07  0 So that's why we think in the first year of ownership, we don't think this is going to have a material impact on the overall profit picture, if you look at it that way, that's the way we think about it in the first year
   0.00  1 First of all, just if you look at the sort of overall group sort of underlying revenue growth, it has sort of accelerated over the years up to 4% and so forth
  -0.33  0 So your thought might be quite interesting
   0.03  0 Maybe just for our benefit, could you sort of highlight sort of any areas the business where you particular sort of have sort of relationships in terms of sort of other partners sort of is there any sort of division, which is particularly sort of you've got similar sort of relationships so that they have with ThreatMetrix or sort of just generally across the whole group?  Okay
   0.04  0 On the other hand, any one -- any growth rate in any one market in any one time period is also going to depend on the environment we're selling into, general economic environment, the customer, the health of the customer segments we're selling into and so on, and we don't try to give specific forecast for the second part
   0.00  1 And the closer we get to those decision point and the more that we can quantify the increased value from that decision, the higher value we're providing to them
   0.00  1 So that's how we think about growth driving, growth acceleration across all our customer sets
  -0.20  0 Then, of course, we still have a little bit here and there or what I call sort of traditional drag
   0.00  1 Our main strategic focus is add customer value and drive accelerated growth that way
  -0.33  0 The second question was on ThreatMetrix
   0.08  0 So what we're saying just for our sort of our benefit, I just wondered if there's any sort of other partnership sort of similar that you have in the business to what you have ThreatMetrix to just identify for us
  -0.06  0 No, no, we have small partnerships around the business everywhere, and in particular in the risk business, we have lots of licenses and partnership agreements with different data sets, different providers, so content or sometimes distribution partners
   0.20  0 So we constantly get to know lots of these companies that have data sets or distribution or an integration opportunity
   0.00  1 It's really when we see that this really add significant -- significantly more value when you can offer them in combination
  -1.00  0 Three questions if I could
  -0.17  0 In the last, say, 12 months, you have signed quite a lot of deals on general subscriptions
   0.20 -1 The beginning of last year was slightly, slightly less attractive than it had been the prior couple of years
  -0.25  0 Now like you said, the first one you said about our contracts
  -0.29  0 About every year, because some of those are 1-year and many of them are multiyear, that means that every year, we probably renew -- renegotiate, I should say, renegotiate about half of those each year
  -0.25  0 So we're talking about well over 2,000 individual renegotiations every year
   0.20  0 We are here to help our customers in their pursuit of advancing research, advancing science that sometimes include health care
   0.00  1 We provide those services to them at, as you know, above-average market quality and below-average market pricing
   0.00 -1 And price trends over time, ours have been below-average market price trends
   0.05  0 When we go into a contract renewal, when we get into a negotiation, we always do everything we can to make sure that we sit down with all these institutions every year and make sure we understand what it is they are trying to achieve in terms of research, in terms of science, what information they need, what tools they want to use
   0.00  1 And   we try to work with them to figure out a way that we can help them reach their objectives in a way that they ultimately find economically attractive solution for them
  -0.09  0 So the second question you asked was what percent of our total article share is roughly is gold open access as you referred to, the sort of fee per article
   0.00  1 We are now approaching, let's call it, we are above mid-single digits but not yet at double-digit percent of our article share internally
  -0.25  0 And lastly, you've made a few disposals
  -0.20  0 Can you share with us the revenues that you've disposed of annually, annual revenues and what the revenue trends were for the asset's disposal?  Okay
  -0.07  0 When we say primary research, we include all content sets, all primary research, everything you would have called historically the journal business, right, but it's primary research
   0.00 -1 So once you take those out, you're down to almost exactly half the revenues, sometimes a little more, a little less
   0.00  1 And that means that in the countries that are fast-growing countries or very large Asian countries, where we don't have a lot of historical local presence, that number is significantly higher than 50%
   0.00  1 So many Asian countries, many developing markets, it's significantly higher than 50% is the subscription base for large broad research collections
   0.00 -1 and some other large developed Western economies, that number is, therefore, below 50% on the subscription -- subscription business as a part of our total Elsevier business
  -0.07  0 And also of course, don't forget in there, we also have individuals that subscribe, individual scientists, health professionals, often related to some health and biomedical content and some society-related
   0.00  1  You reported an acceleration in new sales, basically
   0.00  1 And it continues to grow as we hope to
  -0.33  0 Then disposals, I'm going to let Nick cover
  -1.00  0 But most of that is the disposals
   0.25  0 Obviously, some of that is a part year effect because it has some of them in the part of the year
   0.17  0 So that depends on which particular segment you're looking at
   0.00 -1 But generally, they are going down but at a modest rate
  -0.20  0 A couple of questions loosely associated with STM
  -0.09  0 At what point does supplying a customer with a product for nothing begin to annoy other customers who are paying for that product? Secondly, 180 is a number familiar to us in Germany
   0.08  0 And then thirdly, do you have any views on ResearchGate and your ability to restrict the availability of your copyrighted information on ResearchGate?    Let's see here
  -0.33  0 So you asked the first question of STM
  -0.17  0 When we go through these renegotiations that take place, we spend all our time and effort interacting directly with the individual institutions and trying to understand what their objectives are
   0.00  1 And we are very, very patient and very customer-focused company
  -0.25  0 We are here to serve our customers and not to pride sort of an argument
  -0.11  0 So of course, because they're multiyears agreement, this means that probably just under half of those we are fully renegotiating every single year
  -0.33  0 And when they take place, they are more complicated discussions
  -0.04  0 And the question you asked about ratios, I think you can, from my previous description of the size of our overall business and the size of the academic -- the size of subscription part and the corporate part and the geographic differences, combined with the chart we have shown you, that Europe in total for STM, including the U.K., is about 25% of the revenue
  -0.21  0 Every company in an intellectual property business will have to deal with IP protection, copyright, illegal activities or illegal postings or violation of intellectual property rights
   0.08  0 And typically, what happens when something comes up is that through industry associations or affiliated groups, they contact any one of these sites and they inform them of what the rights are and what you're allowed to do
   0.12  0 And we're talking, depending on how you look at it, well over 5,000 institutions or close to 200 large, complex consortia
   0.00  1 And we want to work with them to get them -- to help them reach their objective in a way that they think is economically attractive
   0.00  1 And is it sort of the identity fraud product expansion, so particularly in light of the threat [Audio Gap]  I'm personally excited about both of those and a few others because I see significant opportunities for us to take our assets which relate to content sets as well as analytical algorithms, mathematical tools as well as technology platform capabilities to combine the information with the [indiscernible] with the technology tools to drive significant value
  -0.14  0 But we also know that these are complicated businesses and individual locations are different, which means that they are not very quick buildups
   0.12  0 We can transfer the analytical tools, our industry knowledge and our technology platform relatively easily
  -0.10  0 You could argue that as you said, some of the other ones that are related to ThreatMetrix, that there, that you could argue that it's easier to establish a local presence
   0.25  0 So we're not dependent on a certain pace of international expansion even though we're excited by it
   0.00  1 But let's put it this way, the number of consortia have continued to grow over time in a steady stream
   0.00  1 And normally, when they're combining, when they have -- when they're working through their role and how they can add value and how we can add value, and we are fully supportive of all of them using all the tools available to them to get the best deal possible in their mind
   0.00  1 And when you do that at above-average quality and below-average price and below-   average price trajectory, it shouldn't be a surprise that the demand for our services keeps growing
  -0.20  1 And therefore, our number of submissions keeps growing and our rejection rate increases every year
   0.00  1 But if you were any customer of that, it would be really, really important for you to make sure that you get the right deal from a company like ours
   0.00  1 And if some of them feel that taking a bit longer and being a little bit more vocal about it helps them, we have full respect for that
   0.00  1 The numbers have continued to grow
  -0.12  0 Every institution in the world that conducts research is a customer of some part of our content sets
  -0.25  0 We published quite a bit over 400,000 articles last year
  -0.50  0 And our objective is to continue to do that
  -0.10  1 But we also want for our customers to get value from it and feel that they're doing it in a way that suits their objectives and their economic structure
   0.50  0  Okay, great
   0.14  0 Just on Lexis Advance, you said that's rolled out now completely across the U.S
   0.20  0 And you always said about the decommissioning and what that has the effect on margin
   0.10  0 Or shall I think of it as part of the sort of gradual effect?  It's part of a journey because U.S
   0.50  0 And then effectively, all the usage has now rolled over
  -0.10  0 When we talk about the platform, we're talking about a few hundred individual components, content sets, databases, software tools
   0.00  1 And then last question is you seem actually pretty confident that STM can sustain the growth rates that we've seen in '16 and '17
  -0.07  0 But one-off, and this is what most customers understand when they work this through in detail, that to work that way with limited subscription, interlibrary loans and so on, it takes a lot longer and it's actually more expensive
  -0.12  0 Then when we offered additional viewing rights only, which has a different interesting history, that you subscribe to certain content sets and you pay and you own those, but then we started to offer very long time ago, before my time here, the broad collections, where you say in addition to that, you can pay a limited amount of money you get access to all the other content on an annual basis, right, to view all the other content
  -0.33  0 And those are normally the ones that are up for the big renegotiations
  -0.06  0 And typically, the most typical number is that they discover that between 40% and 50% of the usage of the full content set came from the additional broad collection that was not in the original subscription list as a typical conversion result in the first couple of years
   0.00  1 But if they don't see the need for all this because they're very special [indiscernible], they might very well then move out of that broad collection
   0.00  1 But the net, it has been a very steady, significant increase over a very long period of time
   0.10  0 So if you look at that level, anything that you can come up with that is more specialized and more focused or different is not usually that attractive for most research institutions in the world
  -0.25  0 And we are not trying to force anybody to take it
   0.33  0  On your confidence on the..
  -0.50  0 A couple of quick questions
  -0.20  0 And then lastly, just on the collapse of the DLC structure, I just had a question about the -- you're going to continue to be listed in Amsterdam
   0.00  1 It's growing very rapidly
  -0.20  0 And that goes to the second question you said, which is, "What are we doing with all these other tools?" Well, that is exactly in the same direction
  -0.50  0 We publish content
  -0.40  0 We take ownership of that content, we stand by the content
  -0.33  0 We do retractions, we do corrections and so on
  -0.40  0 So we take our role as a publisher of content very seriously
  -0.09  0 So here's your answer to your precise question, that you can use standalone and you can only go in and use one of them at a time, if you would like, that's your decision
  -0.05  0 And therefore, you can follow the decision-making process, not just reading an article, which is one thing, but then taking the content in that article, working with that article, linking it to other similar articles or linking it to datasets in others on our platform, which you wouldn't do if you had a printed-out article
  -0.12  0 You're actually doing research inside the content sets on our platform
   0.00  1 And it adds significantly more value, we believe
   0.17  0 And that's what we're going with the acquisitions as both standalone and as integrated solutions
  -0.50  0 The question about the share listing
  -1.00  0 Just two questions
  -0.14  0 I mean, Erik, you gave some sort of breakdowns in terms of primary research percentage
  -0.20  0 I think looking back to the last time you gave some breakdown in 2015, that number was 59%
  -0.08  1 And the second question is just on the RBA side, I think in the notes, you talked about an expansion in terms of RBA margins due to some portfolio shifts
  -0.20  0 And Nick, you got that question, I'll let you explain that one
  -0.12  0 Yes, so I -- we have shown you so many charts of our revenue breakdown over time for all our different divisions
   0.00 -1 So I know what the number is today, right, and it's probably a few points below that but not many, not many points, just a little bit
   0.00  1 So these will always vary a little bit a few points, right?  So the margin question, Richard, in '17, the portfolio pluses we had were coming from because we're selling lower-margin businesses and the print magazines, for example, were coming out of RBA, which gave us the boost to margins
   0.00  1 Thank you all for listening

   0.00  1 Our key financial metrics of ongoing revenue, ongoing operating profit and free cash flow were all in excess of our medium-term financial targets
   0.00  1 At a category level, Pest Control has performed well
   0.00  1 2017 has been a particularly good year for M&A, focused on growth and emerging markets
   0.00  1 In particular, our joint venture with India's largest pest control company, PCI, represents a strategically important step in a country with massive growth potential
   0.12  0 As a result, the composition of our profits is predominantly weighted towards our core higher growth businesses of pest control and hygiene, which now account for around 90% of the group's operating profit
   0.00  1 Thank you very much
  -0.09  1 He's going to look at the 5 regions, which have delivered a strong overall financial performance in excess of our medium-term guidance
  -0.07  1 We delivered a strong overall performance during the year, with revenue from ongoing operations, which excludes the results of disposed businesses, up by 14.5% at constant exchange rates, with all regions contributing to this growth
   0.00  1 Organic revenue growth continued to build at 3.8% for the full year, and with Pest Control delivering organic revenue growth of 5.8%
   0.00  1 For the second year, our Pest Control business grew overall by over 20%
   0.00  1 And as you can see, free cash flow was also strong, and our balance sheet remains robust
   0.00  1 As I've said, 2017 was an exceptional year for M&A, with 41 acquisitions delivering GBP 225 million of combined annualized revenues
   0.00  1 So in summary, 2017 has been another strong year, both in terms of the underlying performance of our businesses and through the delivery of our M&A agenda, as we again continued to execute our RIGHT WAY strategy at pace
   0.00  1  Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 Ongoing revenue in the year grew by 14.5%, with organic growth of 3.8% and growth from acquired businesses of 10.7%
   0.00  1 Free cash flow was again strong in 2017
   0.00  1 Operating cash flow at GBP 258 million was GBP 11 million higher than the prior year, and free cash flow at GBP 176 million was GBP 19 million higher
   0.00  1 Free cash flow continues to be strong, in line with our medium-term target of 90%
   0.00  1 Revenue grew by 21.1% in the year, driven by the continued strong acquisition pipeline as well as increased organic revenue growth, which was 4.8%, with Pest Control organic growth over 5%
   0.00  1 9 acquisitions were completed in 2017, with annualized revenues of over GBP 100 million, increasing revenues in North America by 16.3%
   0.00  1 Pest Control margins, excluding products, increased by 0.7 percentage points to 16.7%
   0.00 -1 Overall, margins in North America were held back by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, and in particular, the lower margin Residex products business
   0.00  1 Ongoing revenues in Europe were up 7.3% in the year, with strong growth in Germany, Southern Europe and Latin America, which is managed through the Europe region
   0.00  1 Revenues in France grew for the first time since 2014
   0.00  1 and the rest of the world region was up 6.8%, of which 1.4% was organic
   0.00  1 revenues grew by 4.2%, driven by growth in both pest control and hygiene
   0.00 -1 property care market has been challenging, impacting both revenue and profit margins
   0.00  1 Ongoing revenue growth has been strong in the rest of the world, driven by growth in all of its regional clusters
   0.00 -1 However, margins were slightly down due to the impact of the U.K
   0.00  1 Revenues were up 37.3%, with organic revenue growth of 7.6%, with good performance from both pest and hygiene
   0.00  1 Acquisitions contributed growth of 29.7%, primarily due to our joint venture with PCI in India
   0.00  1 Margins increased by 0.2 percentage points, with an increase in organic pest and hygiene margins, offset by the dilutive impact of the PCI joint venture
   0.00  1 Organic revenue growth of 4.2% resulted from good performance in both pest and hygiene
   0.00  1 In terms of EBITDA, EBITDA was favorably impacted by FX movements, which offset the impact of the Haniel JV
   0.00  1 Continuing free cash flow of GBP 176 million was GBP 19 million higher than last year
   0.17  0 Our cash tax paid, as a percentage of profit, remains relatively low, however, at around 15%
   0.08  0 We will continue to apply our capital allocation model, looking for opportunities to invest in acquisitions that meet our target return levels
   0.00  1 Our acquisition pipeline remain strong, and I would anticipate that we will spend between GBP 200 million and GBP 250 million on acquisitions in 2018, including the acquisition of Cannon Hygiene from OCS
   0.00  1 It's increased the reported organic growth of the business from 3% to 3.8%, increased the underlying net margins by 0.3 percentage points, which affected the reduction in central and regional overheads, and a relatively small impact from free cash flow relative to the amount of cash proceeds generated, reduced underlying net CapEx by around GBP 60 million, and significantly reduced our net debt figure
   0.00  1 And we continue to have significant funding capacity, with roughly GBP 600 million of centrally-held funds and undrawn committed facilities at the year-end
   0.00  1 Following a GBP 2 million decrease in central and divisional overheads last year, we would expect 2018 costs to be around GBP 4 million higher, reflecting increased investment in our digital capability
  -0.14  0 As you know, we now report restructuring costs above the line, and these are again expected to be around GBP 7 million in 2018
  -0.29  0 This guidance is for restructuring costs only and does not include one-off items, which by their nature, are more unpredictable
   0.08  0 With our 18% investments in the Haniel JV, combined with our Japanese associate, profit from associates is a more material number in 2018, and in my estimate, is that these will be in the region of GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million
   0.00 -1 And should current exchange rates remain for the remainder of the year, I would estimate an adverse impact on our profits of between GBP 10 million and GBP 15 million
   0.20  0 We estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 22.5%, in line with 2017
  -0.05  0 In terms of other cash flow guidance, I would expect working capital outflows in 2018 at the same level of 2017 at around GBP 15 million, and net CapEx in the region of GBP 165 million to GBP 175 million, reflecting the impact of the Haniel JV, and again, subject to foreign exchange movements
   0.00  1 I introduced this to you at our interims last August when we reaffirmed our focus on the strong core markets of pest control and hygiene, and at the same time, we up-weighted our medium-term financial guidance
   0.00  1 As I'm sure you'll recall, we remain very focused on, first, our core Pest Control and Hygiene businesses, whilst we are protecting and enhancing our workwear business in France,   our U.K
   0.18  0 And third, there's also no change to our focus on building our business on the expertise of our people, or indeed, to our leadership in innovation and digital technologies
   0.00  1 In our Pest Control growth markets, that's North America, the U.K., Germany and Australia, for example, ongoing revenues grew by 16.9%, while in our emerging markets that may include, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, ongoing revenues grew by 57.1%
   0.00  1 As you can see, our pest control business has delivered a 4-year CAGR of 17.2%
   0.00  1 That demand is driven by a number of factors, including increased economic growth, a growing population, urbanization and regulatory change, particularly, in areas such as food safety, as well as the drive for consistent international standards
   0.00  1 As you can see on the right of the screen, in North America, we've undertaken a long-term program to create value, delivering a full year CAGR of 23.2%
   0.00  1 Today, we're the #3 business in this market, with over 300 local branches, and we continue to build scale and density in key cities in order to expand our margins
  -0.07  1 Through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, we remain on track to create a business in North America, with revenues in excess of $1.5 billion in margins in the region of 18%, and to do this by the end of 2020
   0.00  1 We have the scale, the brand, the technology and the local experience
   0.00  1 And these markets will be a major platform for the medium-term growth of the company
   0.09  0 So let me update you on our digital and innovation programs in pest control before I move on to hygiene
  -0.20  1 Over the last 12 months, we've increased our web inquiries and contacts by over 30%
   0.25  0 Not only is it highly effective, but it also uses up to 60% less energy
   0.00  1 Both products have been tested against existing competitor ranges to ensure that they set new benchmarks in the industry, and initial sales for both of these have been well above our year 1 targets
   0.10  0 Now Power Center, that's our new global home for science, innovation and training, which we opened here in the U.K
   0.33  0 came from innovations that were launched in the last 2 years
   0.00  1 That's up a further 5 percentage points on 2016
   0.00  1 As you can see, our Hygiene business has delivered a 4-year CAGR of 4.9%, with ongoing revenues reaching GBP 403 million in 2017
   0.10  0 The proof of service is e-mailed to the customer at the end of the visit, and the data is uploaded to our customer data systems, allowing our customer care teams to view the information and easily deal with customer queries
   0.17  0 Today, in Asia, for example, we have over 1,200 techs trained and enabled with ServiceTrak
   0.33  0 However, no integration of the U.K
   0.12  0 We've got 3 main businesses in Protect and Enhance: Ambius, a U.K
   0.00  1 Each of these business is profitable and cash generative, but each of them has weaker growth characteristics than our Pest and Hygiene businesses
   0.33  0 Together, they account for about 11% of group profits
   0.00  1 In Ambius, we've got a good business
   0.00  1 We have high levels of expertise and customer service
   0.00  1 Property Care business, we have unrivaled expertise in woodworm and damp-proofing services
   0.00  1 And we've created a national business with scale
   0.08  0 property market, so our focus here is on cost and on efficiency, whilst also sharing our digital expertise from pest control
   0.00 -1 Whilst we're continuing to make good operational progress in this business, as expected, 2017 remained challenging, with continued margin pressure in a highly competitive marketplace
   0.00  1 However, as I mentioned earlier, with our new team, our new plan in place and having disposed of 8 breakeven flat linen laundries, we remain on track to return this business into profitable growth by the end of this year
   0.20  0 So finally, I want to touch briefly on 2 areas of great importance as key enablers of sustainable profitable growth that I referred to in our model earlier
   0.12  0 Firstly, into our people agenda, and secondly, it's the importance of great customer service
   0.00 -1 One of the biggest challenges affecting companies all around the globe today is the ability to attract and retain the right numbers and the right quality of people
   0.00  1 And as you can see from the illustration on the right, there's also an appealing financial angle to this
   0.11  0 For colleague motivation and enablement, these have been verified externally now at world-class levels for the first time
   0.00  1 And as you can see there on the right, we're also seeing some important external recognition
   0.00  1 And as you can see, our Net Promoter rating is very strong, with a score of over 40 points
   0.00  1 It was an exceptional year for M&A
  -0.20  0 We then completed the Haniel JV, then the disposal of 8 laundries in France
   0.09  0 First, as you know, we monitor the integration and performance of our acquired businesses very closely to ensure that they are continuing to meet our financial hurdles
   0.00  1 As you can see for all acquisitions, in the last 18-month monitoring period, every one of the deals is delivering the expected returns at/or above its respective target levels
   0.00  1 This is our RIGHT WAY strategy in action, and obviously, we're going to continue to execute this aggressively in 2018
   0.00  1 So finally then, in summary, in 2017, we delivered a strong performance
   0.00  1 We exceeded our medium-term targets
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 I think at the first half, that was up 1.6 percentage points
  -0.25  1 Second question, you talked about the strong pipeline in M&A
   0.17 -1 So yes, the root to margin development isn't always going to be smooth
   0.10 -1 So you will get some quarters from time to time, depending on the impact, particularly in Q4, which tends to be a lower revenue quarter
  -0.10  0 On pipeline of M&A, so I've been doing M&A for 30 years, so it's a subject that's pretty close to my heart
   0.00  1 I'd say our M&A pipeline is as strong as I've ever seen it
   0.00  1 We spent a long time building that pipeline, not just in markets, like North America, which obviously a strong target; but right across the globe, and we've got in-house capability now that we've put in place in all of our regions
   0.00 -1 So I think the supply is not drying up, if anything
   0.00  1 So we've reflected on the need to be competitive for assets by, saying, actually, provided we do what we do, deliver against the targets, 13% IRR is a very, very respectable return
   0.00  1 So for me, I think any other point I'd make on M&A is, this is a very -- it's a very well-articulated plan within our company
   0.00  1 We go after the companies that we want to go after, the cities that we want to target, the management teams that we want to join us, the brands that we think would sit well within our business, the quality of operations and the price points
   0.00  1 So I will state that not all acquisition targets are created equal out there, and one of the things I'd like to think we do well is to select the best businesses
  -0.09  1 On the preferred supplier agreement, I'd say we've had good relationships with both companies for quite some time
  -0.25  1 We've been a good supplier to Sodexo for quite a while
   0.00  1 That is ISS have has placed 2 preferred supplier agreements for pest control, 1   with us and 1 with another company, and we are hopeful over the next 2 or 3 years that we can see really good increase in revenue from that customer arrangement
   0.33  0 So the thing with global preferred supplier agreements, very often, winning them is sometimes the easy way
  -0.33  0  A question on behalf of Sylvia Barker from Deutsche Bank
   0.17  0 How much operating profit from known M&A will flow through into 2018?  From 20 -- okay
   0.07  0 The areas, I guess, to focus on of GBP 100 million in the U.S., where I've been just saying to Jane, I think as we drive the synergies out to those deals, do we get the profit from those pieces
   0.00  1 We don't tend to disclose the absolute profit, but what we're looking for is double-digit returns in year 2 of the deliveries
   0.14  0 I guess, overall, Katharine, what the M&A drives is the 10% profit guidance, so it forms part of that build, and it's part of the model to drive the 10% profit growth
   0.06  0 So while I wouldn't want to disclose the profit overall on the acquisitions, not least because some of those we're still looking to get clearance on, the overall number, I think, will depend on our 10% guidance for the year
  -0.20  0  Thanks, Jeremy, and 3 questions also from Allen Wells at Exane on European margins in Cannon
   0.00 -1 European margins were down 130 basis points year-on-year
   0.00 -1 With Cannon, it looks like it's a 6% margin business, well below RTO's hygiene margins
   0.00 -1 You can see that in the figures in terms of the decline in profitability in France
   0.12  0 There is a mix effect in LatAm, so LatAm is similar to Asia and North America as far as it's a growth market
  -0.14  0    The second question related on Jeremy's touched on a little bit
   0.00  1 And as I've talked many times, the way you create margins in the route- based businesses that we operate is all about local density, so where the combination of those assets gives us local city density, we would drive margins up accordingly
   0.00 -1 So the short answer is absolutely no reason why we won't get the Cannon margins up
  -0.14  0 We've got the crystal ball out, but -- so the first question, in terms of the GBP 1.5 billion, 18%, now that's the whole of the North American business
   0.00  1 We're growing 4.5%, 5%, 6% North America
   0.00 -1 And then if we have a few fallow quarters, as they happen from time to time, it will take a bit longer
   0.00  1 But I think it's a pretty good target
   0.00  1 And as I mentioned earlier, I think the pipeline at the moment is pretty good
   0.00 -1 So absolutely no reason why we won't deliver that
  -1.00  0 Third question?  Weather
    nan -1  Weather
   0.20  0 Well, I don't think -- it depends how long this goes on for here
   0.00 -1 When the weather is really a whiteout conditions, and clearly, we can't get our vans on the road to service customers
   0.00 -1 But I'll be -- at this stage, I'll be surprised if we could see it, let alone anyone else externally looking
   0.00 -1 We did have a season in America 3 or 4 years ago, where it was absolutely freezing cold, which affected the whole book pattern, and that's very different
  -0.50  0  A question from Josh Masser of Morgan Stanley
   0.00 -1 Q4 as well is a relatively soft month versus Q3 because Q3 is the more seasonal pest month
  -0.17  0 We also have a big contract with CDC around Zika that's coming to an end, or worse coming to an end when the hurricane hit
   0.12 -1 At the moment this year, we've got revenue back into growth, but profit still went backwards
   0.00  1 So the ambition is to see the top line growing and the bottom line growing
   0.00 -1 Flat linen into health care, hospitals, et cetera, is a really tough sector
   0.00 -1 Everywhere in the world, it's a tough sector
  -0.11  0 So   we took the step to move outs of the weakest parts of the operations, which was most of our flat linen into [indiscernible]
   0.00  1 We've got a new head of French business, who's been in now for about a year, and he's very energetic, dynamic individual
   0.33 -1 I don't think this will be easy
  -0.50  0 Hopefully, that answers your question
   0.00 -1  In terms of numbers, France was down about 7% or about GBP 3 million, and that's predominantly due to the workwear business
  -0.50  0  Question from Chris Bamberry of Peel Hunt
   0.00  1 Some of the economies, some of the state employment is very strong, and we're seeing some wage inflation
   0.00 -1 So I don't think it's the biggest issue we've got in terms of employment
   0.00  1 There are other strong economies, parts of Australia, parts of Europe, parts of the U.K, where employment is equally full, and we take the same approach around the group, making sure we do everything we can to retain our people through the employer of choice, and paying around the inflation level
   0.00  1 So this is an area that we believe, that if you could be really, really good at this, that's the way to combat the fact that there are generally fewer people looking for the vacancies that are out there
   0.10  0 We do a lot on variable pay as well as fixed pay to give people the opportunity to make more money for those people that want to make more money
   0.00  1 So we keep our pay schemes very flexible, and that tends to work for us
  -1.00  0    Question from the Sylvia Barker of Deutsche
  -0.09  0 How much you should we think about Hygiene organic growth in the first quarter of 2018 and onwards?  Sylvia, you're asking more questions by not being in the room than when you're in the room
   0.00  1 In '16, I think we delivered 4%, which was a very much a top performance, top performance that we've delivered in a very long time
   0.00  1 Last year, we delivered just over 2%
   0.10  0 So overall, I would imagine that our Hygiene business will be in 2% plus, but some of that will depend on specific market factors
   0.00 -1 I have no doubt we'll outperform in some quarters and we'll probably underperform, potentially, depending on specific factors
   0.00  1 business
   0.00  1 So no real guidance on Q1, but the Hygiene business is in very good shape
   0.08  0 Just wondering if you have a comment on how you guys plan on addressing that, and if you're doing anything proactively to kind of address that competitive aspect?  Thanks
   0.17  0 I mean, one of the great things about business is you've always got competitors, and you always will have competitors
   0.00  1 Terminix is a good heritage large pest control company that has built its franchise predominantly on termite and residential and has a new management team, and a new strategy, publicly stated, as you say, to be more focused on commercial
   0.11  0 And I won't really comment on the Copesan deal, other than to say I think that will be an interesting deal to integrate
   0.00  1 Good luck to them is what I will say
  -0.07  0 And secondly, what sort of medium-term organic drop through margins are reasonable expectations?  So yes, in terms of price tends to be market-related
   0.00  1 So it's about 2% to 2.5%, but with obviously good volume growth as well
  -0.33  0 So that gives you an indication of the drop through
  -0.20  0 You tend to get a lag impact from M&A
  -0.25  0 One more question with regards to the U.S
   0.14  0 Part of that is a more profitable group, and about GBP 4 million to GBP 5 million of it is U.S
   0.33  0 It's -- effective rate is 22.5%
  -1.00  0  No more questions from Sylvia?  No more questions
  -0.33  0 If there are no other questions, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen
   0.00  1  Thank you

  -0.07  1 I think DB, Deutsche Bank, got an actuary to do the temperature control because between the Arctic out there and the tropics in here, on average, it's probably quite pleasant, but -- okay
  -0.33  1 I know off is impossible for most of you, but silent will be good
   0.00  1 We maximized cash generation through value over volume
  -0.25  0 We reshaped the portfolio with divestment proceeds of $2.7 billion
   0.00  1 We invested $2.5 billion in high-return growth
   0.00  1 So our strategy is clearly working, and we have real momentum
   0.00  1 First, strong financial performance
  -0.17  0 In 2017, we delivered net cash from operating activities of $13.9 billion and $2.7 billion of divestment proceeds
   0.00  1 Our strong operational cash flow is a result of 3 factors: resilient prices during the year, solid operational performance right across the business and our new mine- to-market initiatives
   0.00  1 As you know, we announced record cash returns to our shareholders in 2017
   0.10  0 The Silvergrass iron ore mine was officially opened in August, and work at Amrun and Oyu Tolgoi is advancing
   0.00  1 We have a compelling growth pipeline that we can bring online at the right time
   0.00  1 In '17, we also further strengthened our portfolio, generating $2.7 billion of proceeds from more divestments including Coal & Allied
   0.00  1 So in summary, we are in good shape
   0.25 -1 But let me be clear: I can assure you we are not becoming complacent at all
   0.00  1 Our mission remains the same: all of our employees and contractors must return home safely at the end of each and every day
   0.00  1 We are working very hard to try and ensure this never happens again
  -0.25  0 We are focusing on fatality prevention through our critical risk management program, which is now well embedded across the company with 1.5 million safety verifications in 2017
   0.00  1 We all know that a safe operation is a well-run operation
   0.00  1 Every part of the business is focused on maximizing cash through driving productivity from mine to market
   0.00  1 In Copper & Diamonds, we delivered free cash flow of $319 million including $1.2 billion in development capital expenditure as activity ramped up at the Oyu Tolgoi underground project
   0.00  1 These are another strong set of results
   0.00  1 In Iron Ore, benchmark 62% prices held up very well during 2017, and demand for high-grade products saw us realize a strong full year iron ore price of $64.80 per tonne FOB, 21% higher than last year
   0.00 -1 We spoke at the investor seminar in December about anticipating a potential slowdown in China in the first 6 months of this year and so far we have seen some softening in Chinese construction, but pricing has remained firm
   0.00  1 The LME price for aluminum also improved with an increase of 23%, reflecting strong demand, weakness in the U.S
   0.00  1   In addition to the strong LME prices, the Midwest premiums performed well, averaging $199 per tonne, an increase of 18% on 2016
   0.00  1 On top of this, we have increased the contribution of value-added products from 54% of our portfolio to 57% at an average premium of $221 a tonne
  -0.14  1 Copper prices increased 27% compared to last year, reflecting strong demand from China and supply disruptions during the period
   0.00  1 Realized hard coking coal prices were 42% higher on average compared with 2016
   0.00  1 While these have come off from those levels, strong demand from China and a tight supply chain have meant prices have remained strong compared with 2016
   0.00  1 2017 saw strong steel mill margins, peaking well above $100 a tonne, and they remained above that level for most of the second half of the year
   0.00 -1 To put this in context, these margins compared with an extended period of negative profitability during 2015 and '16, some might see that as losses maybe, but -- and remained well above the $20 to $25 per tonne, which Chinese mills have typically considered attractive
   0.00  1 This meant strong demand for higher-grade products and a widening between the 58% and 62% product prices
   0.00  1 Our world-class Pilbara business continues to deliver strong EBITDA margins, increasing to 68% this year
  -0.11  1 Our world-class aluminum assets have delivered EBITDA margins of 35%, well in excess of others in the market
   0.00  1 With the Aluminium business, we have the hydropowered Canadian smelters, which are in the first quartile and even first decile of the cost curve
   0.00  1 Underlying earnings are up 69% on last year
   0.00  1 This chart shows clearly that recovery in prices in 2017 across our commodities with prices increasing earnings by $4.1 billion versus 2016
   0.00 -1 In the first half of the year, Pilbara shipments and hard coking coal production was impacted by significant cyclonic weather
   0.00  1 A strong second half, particularly in the Pilbara and the Australian bauxite operations, meant that we were able to recover volumes for the year and production finished pretty much in line with 2016
   0.00  1 In the first half results in August, we were able to announce that we'd completed that program 6 months ahead of schedule
   0.08 -1 But we will continue to be tough on costs and are raising efficiencies through our mine-to-market productivity program, which we set out at a seminar in December
   0.12  0 So let's have a look at now at our progress on the mine-to-market productivity this year
   0.20  0 Benefits from value-added products are   reflected in actual revenues achieved coming through the price variance
   0.11  0 As before, the cash cost variance excludes the effects of inflation, energy costs and exchange rates
   0.00 -1 For example, the current headwinds on input prices for coke, pitch and caustic have not been forgiven
  -0.17  0 As a reminder, this means removing the impact of assets that are scheduled for closure in the next 5 years
   0.22 -1 To successfully deliver our mine-to-market program, we must ensure that these benefits are sustainable and embedded
   0.00 -1 Against that $600 million, however, we expect cost headwinds of approximately $300 million in 2018 as raw material inputs, primarily in the Aluminium business referenced earlier, continue to increase
   0.00  1 It's currently delivering around 10 million tonnes of low-cost additional capacity, supporting our highly valued Pilbara blend product
   0.25  0 During the year, we installed both the wharf and the plant beneficiation modules
   0.08  0 AutoHaul is progressing with around 60% of all train kilometers now completed in autonomous mode and we're on track to have this fully operational by the end of this year
   0.00  1 Both of these projects are highly value accretive
   0.00  1 During 2017, we reduced our net debt to $3.8 billion, a 60% reduction from the end of the previous year
  -0.10  0 The first is $1.9 billion on market Rio Tinto plc share buyback program announced in September 2017, following the Coal & Allied divestment
   0.00  1 It provides us with what I refer to as the 3 Rs: robustness, returns and readiness
  -0.11  1 Robustness against volatility in the commodity markets in which we operate, but also in a global macro and geopolitical space
   0.00  1 Strong balance sheet provides an ability to make returns, there's the second R through the cycle
  -0.17  0 We also generated additional cash from asset disposals of $2.8 billion, meaning that we have $16.7 billion available to be allocated
  -0.11  0 $1.9 billion arising from the Coal & Allied disposal was allocated for the supplementary plc buyback and that'll be completed during 2018
   0.00  1 We've delivered strong results this year with solid margins and cash flow of $13.9 billion
   0.00  1 We have a defined growth pipeline of high-value projects, which we continue to deliver
   0.00  1 The flexibility of this new returns policy means that, as anticipated, shareholders are participating more fully in those returns
   0.00  1 We've been able to distribute above the top end of our guided 60% of underlying earnings
   0.25  0 Since introducing the policy, we have stepped above the range at each opportunity
  -0.20  0   Let's look at the breakdown of these returns
  -0.12  0 And then, we did the off-market buyback in Rio Tinto Limited of $0.6 billion related to the Coal & Allied proceeds, that was also completed in November of 2017
  -0.09  0 The $2.5 billion supplementary buyback was split between Rio Tinto Limited and plc on the waiting of the DLC as you'll see on the next slide
  -0.14  0 There's also the $1.9 billion of share buyback arising from the Coal & Allied disposals that'll be executed this year
  -0.06  1 Whether running operations, committing capital expenditure, evaluating disposals or acquisitions, we've remain disciplined and focused on the delivery on the value of every dollar
   0.00 -1 In particular, construction, infrastructure and automotive [ dividend ] growth may weaken
  -0.11  0 The party congress restated its focus on environmental performance starting with the steel industry
   0.00  1 This has resulted in high premiums for our product such as our Pilbara Blend
   0.00  1 This is why productivity is so important
   0.00  1 We remain absolutely focused on driving strong performance across the business
   0.00 -1 This chart shows that we can expect to see around a 5% reduction in steel capacity in China due to supply-side reforms in 2017 and 2018
   0.00 -1 In addition, further reductions in capacity will occur over the winter period as a result of environmental policy impacts
   0.00  1 This is good news for Rio Tinto's Pilbara Blend, which meets the high-quality requirements of our Chinese customers
   0.00  1 We see annual growth of around 4%, and we expect this trend to continue over the next 15 years
   0.00  1 This is underpinned by growth in the transport sector with the uptake in electric vehicles
   0.00  1 The fundamentals of the supply side are looking increasingly favorable
   0.00 -1 In the short term, this is driving market tightness and this is expected to result in balanced inventory levels of 7 to 8 weeks before the end of this decade, much earlier than previously expected
  -0.07  1 More significantly over the medium to longer term, we expect China to be broadly balanced in aluminum, which creates significant implication for supply from the rest of the world
   0.00  1 In copper, we have large high-quality expandable resources at Oyu Tolgoi and potentially Resolution
   0.00  1 And our high-quality Energy & Minerals portfolio has already shown its capability to increase supply into a growing market
   0.00  1 We have a significant capacity and flexibility across our entire portfolio to deliver low-capital, high-return growth
   0.33  0 There is no better example of this than the Pilbara
   0.00  1 This work includes the increased tonnage expected from AutoHaul
   0.00  1 Shipping a record 90 million tonnes in the final quarter of 2017 demonstrated the capacity and the flexibility we are developing
   0.00  1 We can deliver more material at the same cost or the same material at a lower cost
   0.00  1 We are looking at best practices outside our industry and building our technical and commercial capability
   0.00  1 The commercial team is working hand in hand with the product groups to grow value across customer and supplier chains
   0.00  1 We already have real momentum towards our annual exit rate of $1.5 billion in additional free cash flow in 2021
  -0.10  1 Quality growth projects such as Amrun and the Oyu Tolgoi underground will deliver IRRs in excess of 20%
   0.00  1 The underground project is 18 months into a 5- year program and is well on track
   0.00  1 Looking ahead, we will maintain our strong performance by focusing on the 4P strategy: portfolio, performance, people, partners
   0.00  1 Every decision we make at Rio Tinto will prioritize value over volume, and we are continuing to deliver
   0.00  1 We generated $13.9 billion of cash in 2017, and we will continue to drive cash from our world-class assets with an additional $5 billion of free cash flow to be delivered by 2021 through our productivity program
   0.00  1 We continue to manage and shed the portfolio to raise returns from our asset base
   0.00 -1 For example, as I've already said, we will see cost inflation coming back
   0.00  1 But Rio Tinto is in good shape
   0.00  1 We have a resilient business, world-class assets, committed employees and the right strategy
   0.00  1 More importantly, we have significant momentum
   0.00  1 For us, it's about delivering on our promises day in and day out
   0.20  0 Jason?    You want to start?  I'll make an easy one
   1.00  0  So Chris, an easy one
   0.00 -1 Balance sheet is looking underlevered, one-offs notwithstanding
   0.00  1 You're well under that point at the moment
   0.50  0 Keep going, please
   0.00  1  Anyway, but -- so we've got -- so the balance sheet, yes, it's strong
   0.00  1 We were never going to spend our way to the bottom of a range, so we recognize we've got a strong balance sheet
   0.00  1 That gives us a lot of capacity, it gives us that robustness and all those sorts of things that I've talked about previously
   0.05  0 We've got a check for $3.2 billion to write in April, and we've got $2.9 billion to spend in buybacks through the course of this year, and we'll have an opportunity to make another decision, the big decisions at this time of year and I wish they will have an interim decision to make at the half
   0.33  0 So there's plenty of scope for..
  -0.14  0 So how would you describe the current state of affairs between Rio Tinto and the government?  Okay, no worries
   0.00  1 So you got a pretty good sense
   0.00  1 And that's why our mine-to-market productivity, the $5 billion of additional free cash flow that we are targeting in the next 5 years is so important
  -0.67  0 We have diverse and complicated projects
  -0.17  0 Oyu Tolgoi is a large, complicated project like many other projects elsewhere
   0.17 -1 I'm not saying it's going to be easy and it will continue and that's where it is
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of questions
  -0.25  0 So Freeport -- I mean, Grasberg, I restate what I said
   0.00  1 There is no doubt that Grasberg is a fantastic -- is a world-class resource, but there is a fundamental difference between a world-class resource and a world-class business
  -0.11  0 Discussion between Freeport and the government are underway in relation to what are the terms of the extension of the contract that work beyond 2021
   0.12  0 Depending on the outcome of this conversation, we will make up our mind and then we'll come back to the market
  -0.33  0 So if we can go and take a question from the call with our Australian friends
  -0.17  0 [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the audio conference is coming from Clarke Wilkins from Citi
   0.00  1 If China really restructures their aluminum business, then that could create significant opportunities for us
  -0.18  1 The run rate of the closure could be significant, but we want to be really convinced as those closures really happen, and nobody restart them
  -0.11  0 That's -- I mean, that -- knowing straight up that, that number will be wrong, it will be somewhere in that order if we continue down the same path that we're on at the moment
  -0.67  0  Any other questions from the call? Our next question is coming from Paul Young from Deutsche Bank
  -0.20  0  A couple of questions on your Aluminium business
   0.25  0 A lot of this shuffling profits, of course
  -0.17  0 So I presume that's really a longer-term contract
  -0.20  0 So I'm just wondering when do you expect the seaborne market to actually tighten up or move into deficit?  Thank you, Paul
   0.00  1 We try to produce more through the creeping and increase our share of value-added products to extract more value, more margin from the market and therefore offset it [ as a minimum ]
   0.00  1 And so the guys actually did a pretty good   job of offsetting the impact of that
   0.00  1 They weren't able to get all of it out, but they did a pretty good job of getting -- tackling that during 2017
  -0.09  1 But once again, we've got -- back to be aluminum question, we've got multiple growth options above and beyond Amrun
   0.14  0 And depending on the development of the market, then we will add capacity as appropriate
   0.10  0 We have the options and then depending on market conditions, we trigger those options at the right point in time
  -0.33  0 If we take a question in the room
  -0.33  0 Just one question on iron ore
   0.20  0 As you've pointed out in the fourth quarter, you achieved 360 million tonnes annualized shipments
   0.20  0 I'm interested in the profitability of it, okay? So every year, we optimize
   0.09  0 You know very well that there is a big differential premium discount depending on how you want to look at it, between high-grade and low-grade
  -0.33  0 I mean, I don't have any doubt, and you saw it
  -0.07  1 We will get there, but the point is every year, every quarter, you could argue, we will optimize our production to make sure we maximize cash flow, acknowledging that when we add tonnage, we can have an impact on price
  -0.33  0 If we can take another question?  Fraser Jamieson, JPMorgan
   0.00  1 Actually cost performance in iron ore look pretty strong through the year
   0.00  1 That is very, very clear
   0.00  1 So that's why the mine-to-market productivity is so important for us, because we need to push hard to offset, as a minimum, inflation, but it's coming
   0.09  0 But what you're not seeing in the inflation side for those who were around when the -- in big part of the burn was that there's not the construction activity that's commensurate with the operating activity
  -0.06  0 So we've got to be real to it and alert to it, but that's -- and then the structural versus the cyclical, I think what you're seeing with regards to that is that the environmental play in China is also coming across a series of products and, notwithstanding, steel
  -0.25  0 We're currently in the middle of the winter curtailments, so we haven't seen how it comes out of those curtailments if it comes out of those curtailments in terms of the capacity
   0.00  1 And as the rationalization of the state-owned enterprises in China continues, there's endorsement of the more efficient and cleaner producers
  -0.67  0 There's a discouragement of the opposite of that
   0.00  1 And so you are seeing the establishment of sort of a standing demand for the higher-quality material
   0.00  1 So I think we're well placed to participate
   0.00 -1 So we will reduce capacity
   0.00 -1 Our sense is we are moving close to a structural change, but we are always very cautious
   0.00  1 Now what it means for Rio Tinto is to say, it's very simple: as long as we have the right product in terms of cost, in terms of grades and the right relationship with our customer, then we are very well-placed
  -0.33  0 And I think what we have experienced last year and what we are experiencing as we speak, we don't have any problem to place any of our product today, quite the opposite
   0.00  1 We are in good shape
  -0.25  0   So our next question comes from Hayden Bairstow from Macquarie
  -0.20  0  Just a couple of quick questions on the growth options
  -0.50  0  Hence you picking up the question
  -0.20  0  I'm sorry?  Hence you picking up the question?  BFS
   0.10  0 So we're a long way from being in a position to give a notice to proceed on that project, it's very much rudimentary at this stage
  -0.12  0 To do that, we need to put more people on the ground; quite a lot, do lots of drilling
   0.00 -1 But today, unless we have for safety reasons, 2 shafts, we're not going to put those people at risk
  -0.29  0 Let's take another question from the call? Our next question comes from Lyndon Fagan from JPMorgan
  -0.33  0  Another couple of iron ore questions from me
   0.00 -1 And I guess we're now back down to average type levels around $10 a tonne
  -0.20  0 And then the second question, just in terms of you've spoken about China a fair bit
  -0.50  0 I take the question in China
   0.00 -1 Did reduce dramatically, but there is lots of fluctuations
  -0.33  0 We did drop to 235 a few -- 18 months ago and then came back
  -0.25  0 So I'm not going to be able to answer fully your question
   0.00  1 And once again, the only -- so what for us is get the right grade, get the right cost structure, get the right relationship with your shareholders -- sorry, shareholders definitely and your customers as well, and you are in good shape
   0.07 -1 So with regard to lump premium, I think the other thing that's happening in there is around the issue about the degree of the construction activity being the main demand for the steel versus the fabricated products area being more dominant
   0.33 -1 But other than that, it's not a perfect market then
  -1.00  0 A question in the back
  -0.20  0 So the question is very simple is for us, the key project for us is Jadar in Syria
   0.14  0 And we have not concluded on the attractiveness of the lithium market at this point in time
  -0.20  0 One question on cash allocation, or cash flow allocation
   0.00  1 Your cash returns last year was very impressive, and you augmented them by returning basically all the proceeds from asset disposals
   0.00  1 We are very clear about the capital -- the disciplined capital allocation cycle that we have
   0.00 -1 We did an off-cycle last year on the back of the Coal & Allied proceeds, but you can't take any comfort that we will do off-cycle
   0.00 -1 We're not going to grow for the sake of it
   0.00  1 It's about high-quality growth
   0.00  1 We have 3 areas of growth of 3 key levers
   0.00  1 The best return we can have today is to increase the productivity of our assets, and that's the $5 billion that we committed for the next 5 years
   0.00  1 The second   driver is about organic growth
   0.00  1 We have the momentum
   0.00 -1 We just have to keep pushing
   0.17  0 How does this change your views around Rio's position in the alumina market?  Alumina
  -0.17  0 And yes, how do you see the changes around your view about the Pacific Aluminium within Rio in this environment?  Okay, no worries
  -0.50  0 Thanks for the question
   0.00  1 I think we believe that if you've got aluminum smelters, especially like in Canada where you've got on the back of Hydro-based, you make a lot of money and that creates value for shareholders
   0.20  0 So we have to be integrated from a supply chain standpoint, but we try to be integrated as little as we can because alumina is something in-between, and you don't create further value
   0.00 -1 Now having said that, we can see that all our Alumina refineries are making a lot of money today because the team are working hard
  -0.09  0 But if in terms of capital allocation, first of all, go back to your question, the capital allocation across all commodities and all assets is not earmarked by product group
  -0.14  0  And Pacific Aluminium?  Pacific Aluminium, what is your question?    The structural change you see potentially happening in China could potentially change structurally where Pacific Aluminium fits with Rio Tinto?  I think I understand your question
  -0.11  0 So we go back to the call, and then we'll come back to the room, okay? So our next question is coming from Glyn Lawcock from UBS
  -0.09  0 And the second question, you've been talking a lot about growth, and clearly, Zulti South is a replacement, Resolution, by Chris Lynch's comments is a long way off
   0.00  1 So if you were to put aside the M&A for 1 minute, I think the CapEx number in the guidance are pretty rock solid, to be honest
   0.00  1 So for the next 2 or 3 years, it's really rock solid, pretty well-defined and so on, so forth
  -0.20  0 Going back to your other question on the 360 is, as we said, there is still some way to go on the AutoHaul
  -0.11  0 The only question we have now is to work very closely with the regulator to get the right to license, permits and so on, so forth
   0.00 -1 And this one is not totally under our control
  -0.33  0 So thanks for the question, Glyn
  -0.50  0 I understand there are no more question in the   call
  -0.25  0 If there are no questions, don't feel obliged to..
  -0.25  0 Oh, one last question on the call, all right, sorry
  -0.14  0 Sir, our next question from the audio line comes from Sam Webb from Crédit Suisse
   0.00 -1 You've noted that you're very cautious regarding M&A
   0.17  0 So we did set up Rio Tinto Ventures under the leadership of Bold Baatar 18 months ago
  -0.25  0 They are looking at options as we speak, but I can restate what I said
   0.00  1 If it's a good thing that creates value for our shareholders, we will look at it

  -0.11  0 We've got quite a few people online, so if we could be disciplined with microphones later on, that would be very helpful
   0.00  1 But overall, we feel these are a strong set of results
   0.00  1 We've delivered a 15% increase in net income to GBP 2.06 billion
   0.00  1 We declared a full year dividend of 113p, which was up 22% on the previous year
   0.00 -1 One of the things we talked about at the interim stage was a very large outflow in sub-advisory
  -0.11  0 I think big mandate losses will always be a feature, and internalization is definitely a theme in the marketplace
   0.00  1 But the resilience of the business with Intermediary, Institutional and Wealth Management all contributing was an important part of the performance
   0.00  1 Fixed income saw inflows
  -0.09  1 Multi-assets saw inflows; and private assets, which we broken out as a separate segment, also saw inflows
   0.00  1 But we saw good inflows, particularly in global equities and in European equities
   0.00  1 And really, all areas of our fixed income business contributed, particularly the credit areas and emerging debt, but there was a good contribution there
   0.00  1 saw GBP 3.1 billion of flows split GBP 1.2 billion, Institutional; and GBP 1.9 billion, Intermediary, which was a good performance from the U.K
   0.00  1 Europe, another strong year, GBP 4.3 billion of inflows
   0.00  1 And really, good performances, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, really across the piece
   0.00 -1 Asia was somewhat more muted than normal, GBP 0.9 billion of inflows, of which GBP 0.8 billion were in Institutional
   0.14  0 Pleasing for me was that Japan and China, which are strategically very important to us, saw cumulative inflows of GBP 3.3 billion
  -0.14  0 So quite a big barbell within Asia between developing Asia and like more mature markets
   0.18  0 The underlying dynamic there, I think, was very pleasing, because if you have a GBP 5.8 billion mandate out at the beginning of the year, actually, to end up GBP 0.7 billion down was pleasing
   0.00  1 Hartford delivered well, our retail Intermediary partnership, but also the Institutional business delivered well
   0.00  1  Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone
    nan  1 As you just heard, 2017 has been a strong year for Schroders
  -0.14  0 So let's begin with how the results break down and where the growth has come from
   0.00  1 Net income increased by GBP 276 million or 15% to GBP 2.1 billion, driven by the growth in our AUMA, which closed this year up 13% at GBP 447 billion and also as a result of good performance fees
   0.00 -1 That's 1 percentage point down due to changes to our compensation policy for material risk- takers
   0.14  0 The effect is to reduce the accounting charge in 2017, and I will explain how you should think about this in a moment
   0.00  1 Our total cost ratio has reduced to 61%
   0.00 -1 That's 1 percentage point down due to comp cost and a further 2 percentage points down due to other costs
   0.00  1 We have a full year tax rate of 21.4%, which is higher than the 20.5% we had last year
   0.12  0 The increase is mainly due to the reduction in expected benefit of our U.S
  -0.33  0 deferred tax asset
  -0.20  0 It means our deferred tax asset is worth less, and we have taken a charge now
   0.00 -1 Our forecast is for a lower headline rate in 2018, possibly between 20% and 20.5%
   0.29  0 But as you know, this does depend on the mix of profits between the various tax jurisdictions
   0.14  0 The tax charge for 2017 of GBP 172 million takes profit after tax but before exceptionals to GBP 629 million
   0.00  1 As I've already mentioned, the -- I'm sorry, as I have already mentioned, AUMA was up 13%, but the driver of most of our net income is average AUM, and that was up a little more at 19%
   0.00  1 These increased our average AUM by GBP 10 billion
   0.00  1 That's the acquisitions this year and a full year impact of the 2016 acquisitions, which together increased net operating revenue by GBP 57 million
   0.00  1 The next 2 factors, investment returns and FX, increased average AUM by GBP 53 billion, increasing operating revenues by GBP 193 million
   0.00  1 Looking at the 2 components: investment returns have brought strong growth, with related increases in revenues being only partly offset by changes to fee structures
   0.00  1 And as a result, we saw an increase in our revenues of around GBP 68 million
   0.00  1 That's a little higher than the revenue number I just quoted, which is because the impact of 2016 flows has partly offset the growth in this year's revenue
   0.00  1 In 2017, we also generated strong Alpha performance, resulting in performance fees of GBP 78 million, an increase of GBP 37 million on 2016
  -0.14  0 As you know, performance fees are difficult to predict, but at this early stage of the year, we are budgeting GBP 40 million for 2018
   0.00  1 Bringing this all together means a GBP 297 million increase in net operating revenue
   0.00 -1 Lastly, other income decreased by GBP 21 million
   0.00  1 The overall outcome is a 15% increase in net income to GBP 2.1 billion
   0.00  1 Net operating revenues were up GBP 122 million to GBP 814 million, with closing AUM at GBP 256 billion, up 13%
   0.00  1 GBP 30 million of the revenue increase is due to performance fees, which were GBP 58 million
   0.00  1 The remainder was driven by higher average AUM, which was up GBP 37 billion, with revenues up GBP 91 million or 14%
   0.00 -1 Net operating revenue margins, excluding performance fees, were down a little from 32 basis points to 31.5 basis points
   0.00  1 We have seen continued Institutional demand for lower-margin fixed income and multi-asset products
   0.00  1 So that's good for revenues
   0.00 -1 They have, however, pulled down our revenue margins a little
   0.00  1 And as you would expect of a private equity business, it is at a higher revenue margin
   0.25  0 As always, this will be highly dependent on markets
   0.00  1 Net operating revenues were up 17% to GBP 929 million, with AUM of GBP 134 billion at the year-end, which is up 12%
   0.00  1 The increase in revenue was mainly driven by an GBP 18 billion rise in average AUM, with revenues up GBP 124 million or 16%
   0.00  1 We also earned GBP 20 million of performance fees in 2017, which is a year-on-year increase of GBP 8 million
   0.00  1 As we have heard from Peter, we had net new business of GBP 3.4 billion, with demand for higher-margin products
   0.00  1 What is important for us is that those net sales have increased our annualized revenue by around GBP 44 million
   0.00  1 So unlike Institutional, net new business has increased our margins, and importantly, it is bringing strong annualized revenues, which is a key focus for us
   0.00  1 That's a 1 basis point decline over the year and is 2 basis points better than I expected at the half year
   0.00  1 The reason is that higher-margin net new business, combined with strong equity markets, pushed up the higher-margin business as a proportion of AUM
   0.17 -1 Despite margins holding up this year, we still see longer-term pricing pressures
   0.00 -1 And as a result, our margins may fold a little in 2018 by perhaps a bit
   0.20  0 But again, this will depend on how our business mix changes from net sales and markets
   0.00  1 Net operating revenues were up 20% to GBP 267 million
   0.00  1 That was mainly driven by a GBP 42 million increase in management fees, which were up 26% to GBP 204 million
   0.00  1 And you can see on the slide, other income was also up a little
   0.00 -1 That's down 4 basis points, consistent with the guidance I gave you and is due to Benchmark
   0.17  0 But here, the business mix, the level of transactional fees and interest income will all have an effect
  -0.20  0 This required us to increase the proportion of their pay that is deferred
  -0.11  0 The increase in amounts deferred this year has reduced our total comp ratio by 1 percentage point
   0.00  1 That's slightly higher than guidance due to Adveq operating costs
   0.00  1 As a result, we have been able to reduce our total cost ratio by 3 percentage points to 61% in 2017
   0.00  1 As you know, the group has grown significantly in recent years
   0.00  1 This growth is underpinned by our people, and the headcount has increased by around 50% over the same period
   0.00  1 As a result, costs are going up by around GBP 20 million, but this just reflects the growth we have seen and expect to see going forward
   0.00 -1 Finally, as we all know, regulatory demands continue to be significant
   0.00  1 Finally, we're reporting GBP 35 million of exceptional operating expenses
   0.00  1 The increase is mainly driven by the growth in our pension scheme surplus and due to acquisitions
   0.00  1 We've seen this grow from GBP 67 million 5 years ago to GBP 163 million at the end of 2017
   0.06  0 During that same 5-year period, we've seen investment returns of GBP 457 million on opening assets of GBP 777 million despite also investing in LDI assets to derisk the portfolio
   0.25  0 At the same time, we have paid benefits of GBP 242 million
  -0.05  0 It's the combination of acquisitions, increases to our seed and co-investment and strategic spend on our property, estate and technology assets that has reduced our liquid investment capital, which you can see on the right-hand side of this slide
   0.00 -1 That is slightly lower than the figure for 2016 and is due to the investments we have made
   0.00  1 Net income is up 15% to GBP 2.1 billion
   0.00  1 Our good cost discipline has delivered a total cost ratio of 61%
   0.00  1 That, in turn, equates to a 22% increase in basic EPS before exceptional items to 226.9p
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 I just wanted to revisit our progress on that, because I think, to my mind, getting investment for the future right is absolutely mission-critical to being deliver -- able to deliver consistent growth
   0.00  1 And these 7 areas of expansion and investment are really important to our future growth
   0.08  0 And just moving on the chart from left to right, products and solutions, we made some changes in the management team here during the year, and Charles Prideaux is now leading that group
   0.00  1 But more importantly, we've launched our strategic capabilities
   0.00  1 And I think what we're seeing from these results is a number of those new areas starting to deliver good growth
  -0.12  0 And I think for me, getting the right products on the shelf is mission-critical
   0.00  1 And I think that's definitely something that we will return to again
  -0.17  1 But ensuring that we're match fit here is absolutely critical
   0.00  1 What's interesting about this chart, that with the exception of commodities, that all these areas contributed to our growth in private assets this time
   0.00  1 Adveq performed well
   0.00  1 We also saw some important growth in our real estate business
  -0.15  1 We've launched this year what we call our alternative sales force, which is a growing group of people who are dedicated to selling alternatives beyond our traditional sales force, will remain an important area of growth
   0.00  1 Wealth Management business of Cazenove performed particularly well, with GBP 1.7 billion of flows
   0.00  1 And that, for me, is the engine of growth
   0.00  1 So underlying GBP 2 billion of inflows, we completed the whole acquisition of their Wealth Management business, which went well, with staff retention and client retention
   0.00  1 And the Benchmark acquisition has also performed well
   0.00  1 We saw growth of 30%-plus in their EBIT contribution and their revenue growth
  -0.06  1 So across the piece for me, the Wealth Management business really starting to fire, and we've got some really important bits of the jigsaw in terms of the way the Wealth Management landscape is changing
   0.00  1 So again, an important part of our strategic future growth
  -0.33  0 There may well be some people online who've got questions, in which case I would ask them to press the button, and their questions will be relayed into the room
   0.33  0    If you could say your name and organization, that would be great
  -1.00  0 Three questions
   0.00  1 You had an exceptional year of cost income at 61% this -- in '17
   0.11  0 And maybe around that, talk a little bit about valuation in terms of where you're seeing in terms of M&A opportunities out there
   0.00  1 Passive's growing
   0.00  1 Ensuring that we fix the roof and making sure our costs are low is an important part of the strategy
   0.00  1 So in the short term, yes, I would hope we're going to beat that
   0.00  1 And I get slightly frustrated by a commentary which is all about cost when, actually, if we can grow revenues and grow longevity, we're in a really good position
   0.00  1 And that's about partnerships and good client proposition
  -0.20  0 Your second question about acquisitions, you're absolutely right
  -0.50  0 You -- the second part of your question was where
   0.17  0 The private asset space is vast, and that's one of the attractions of it
   0.00  1 I think that makes good sense
  -0.25  0 But that's not to preclude that we won't   do things in other areas
   0.00  1 And finally, on market sentiment, I think it's a very good point
   0.00  1 But I think that what's been remarkable has been the resilience of the marketplace
  -0.14  0 I think it's fair to say we would expect to see more volatility in markets in 2018 than we saw in '17
   0.00 -1 That's not a particularly brave assumption, because how does it get much lower
   0.00  1 I mean, I think there is still a sense that the economies are in good shape
   0.17 -1 Markets are functioning well, and that underlying confidence hasn't been dented
  -0.25  0 Are there any more questions?  It's Charles Bendit from Berenberg
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions
  -0.14  0 And second question, Lloyds Banking Group is maturing a sizable Scottish Widows mandate
  -0.07  0 One is those who need to hold the asset class, and they're matching their liabilities, and it's particularly true in the insurance space; and those who are opportunistically looking to invest in fixed income
   0.00  1 We were fortunate in building our fixed income business over the last 5 years, and we built it in the knowledge that rates were very low
  -0.14  0 So we have got very little exposure to products which are not more total return orientated or opportunistic
   0.00  1 That's an area where we've got very strong performance and have delivered very well
   0.00 -1 One is underlying rates going up, and the other one is this huge thirst for income, which doesn't go away
  -1.00  0 Just 2 questions
   0.00  1 Firstly, in terms of multi-asset, I think your flagship fund has done very well last year versus some of its peers
   0.06  0 And second, just in terms of your technology spend, how should we think about technology spend to sort of be ahead of the pack in terms of revenue opportunities versus sort of cost rationalization or efficiency?  So yes
   0.00  1 So it's got things like income products in there, some multi-asset income products which will remain good; risk mitigation products, which, again, were particularly strong last year; and DGF growth, biased DGF funds, diversified growth funds
   0.00  1 And all of those areas are performing well
   0.14  0 There's a cost and efficiency point, and there's a revenue piece
   0.05  0 So a big investment in their desktop applications, in our data insights team and building the ability to handle very large data sets on the cloud with new coding languages, et cetera, is one part of investment
   0.06  0 And I think what we're looking to do is to maintain high spend to really drive home this sort of extra opportunity that we've got in terms of being on the front foot
   0.00  1 But we're increasingly -- AI helping us on trading algos, et cetera, on decision support will become -- that will move more into revenue space
   0.00  1 And then there's some bits of technology which aren't really technology, but rebranding, getting websites more automated so that they're much more responsive to consumer engagement
  -0.17  0 If there are no questions online, which I'm being told there aren't
   0.00  1 Well, thank you
   0.00  1 Thank you for making the effort to come in through the snow, and thank you for your attention

  -0.09  0 And we generated GBP 525 million from recycling capital out of assets that don't offer the return and defensive qualities that we have elsewhere in our portfolio
   0.00  1 And the output from all of this hard work has been another set of cracking financial results with a total property return of 19%, an NAV increase of 16% and some good uplifts in adjusted earnings per share and dividends
   0.00  1 Italy is expanding rapidly
   0.00  1 We're unique in having a portfolio balanced between big box logistics assets as well as high-growth urban or last-mile warehouses
   0.00  1 And as we see the structural trends of urbanization, growth of the digital economy and e-commerce penetration continue apace in the U.K
   0.00  1 We started 2018 with good momentum
   0.00  1 And we've already had some good leasing successes with low vacancy rates in all markets, limited speculative supply and constraints to new supply being brought through, there are good prospects for further rental growth
   0.20 -1 And whilst there are plenty of macro risks out there that may affect the broader economy, the attractive fundamentals benefiting our sector, which are structural in nature, are unlikely to change anytime soon
   0.00 -1 Not surprisingly, therefore, investor appetite for good industrial stock remains unsated, meaning current valuations are well supported
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.17  0 So starting with what I think are a really great set of figures
   0.00  1 So we saw strong growth in earnings through 2017
   0.00  1 The main drivers were higher rental income and lower finance costs, and I'll come on to expand on both shortly
   0.00  1 NAV is up 16% to 556p per share, and loan-to-value remains at the lower end of our target range at just [ 30%
   0.00  1 ] We're announcing a 6% increase in the dividend -- the final dividend, to 11.35p per share, which takes the full year dividend to 16.6p per share, which is also up 6%
  -0.08  0 As you can see, the impact of acquisitions and disposal roughly net each other out, whilst development completions add about GBP 20 million to the top line
   0.20  0 and in Europe reflect the under and the over rented positions that have been built up from recent years
   0.14 -1 And we anticipate the European over rented position reducing as ERV growth there picks up
   0.00 -1 The vacancy rate at 4% is, I think, the lowest we've ever reported
   0.00  1 And if we can maintain it at around these levels, the prospect for continued like-for-like rental growth should be good
  -0.12  0 The blue bar on the right-hand side just shows the pro forma run rate for net rent, which adjusts for one-offs and the timing of acquisitions, disposals and the completions of developments
   0.00  1 And this would be about GBP 5 million higher than the actual 2017 figure
   0.00  1 On the third box in the right-hand side, you can see the cost ratio's increased from 23% to 24.6%
   0.00  1 Excluding the share schemes, the cost ratio would have risen much more modestly by 0.7% to 21.7%, which mainly reflects higher staff costs
   0.00  1 So EPRA NAV per share has risen from 478p to 556p
   0.00  1 The valuation gain increased NAV by 96p, of which the development surplus comprised a significant piece at 17p
   0.00  1 The valuation gain totaled just under GBP 1 billion, reflecting mainly a 13% increase in the like-for- like portfolio
   0.00  1 was the major driver of this growth, particularly London and Slough, but as you can see, there's also a very healthy contribution from the French, the German and the Italian assets as well
   0.00  1 portfolio generated a capital value uplift of 15.8%
   0.00  1 And that compares very favorably to the IPD all industrial quarterly index, which grew 13.9%
   0.00  1 The valuation increase is really the increase -- is really the result of the asset management activities, yield shift and of rental growth
  -0.08  1 Yields tightened about 40 basis points across the portfolio but continue to offer a healthy margin to the risk-free rate as well as rental growth
   0.00  1 In London, the portfolio equivalent yield was 4.8%, whilst the ERV growth was 4.6%, with particularly strong performance in Park Royal and in the North and the East London portfolios
   0.00  1 We've also seen ERV growth in Continental Europe
   0.00  1 We raised GBP 2.7 billion of fresh capital in 2017, which is an extraordinary level of activity and has transformed our capital structure
  -0.12  0 And finally, at the end of the year, we added to our credit facilities, which means we now have over GBP 1 billion of undrawn liquidity
  -0.05  0 Now looking forward, when you're thinking about your forecasts, we expect to maintain a high rate of CapEx, so in excess of GBP 350 million a year on development, with -- in the order of another GBP 50 million related to infrastructure, mainly at East Midlands Gateway
    nan  1  Very good
   0.00  1 Heathrow's cargo volumes jumped 10% last year to a new all-time high, and space has been in demand across the portfolio
   0.00  1 So the assets have performed well since acquisition, and there's a slide in your appendix with some of the details that you might want to look at
   0.00  1 Finally, despite having completed over GBP 3 billion worth of disposals in the previous 5 years, we continued to take a disciplined approach to managing and reviewing the existing portfolio, constantly looking for opportunities to recycle capital out of assets which offer less upside or are not as defensive as the rest of our portfolio
   0.11  0 Another important element of our investment strategy though, has been to focus on achieving scale in all our chosen markets
   0.00  1 As I mentioned earlier, we're in pretty good shape now in Germany, France and Central Europe, with over GBP 1 billion of assets under management in each of those
   0.00  1 In Spain, a lack of suitable corporate acquisition targets means that our growth has had to follow a much more organic approach, but we're making very good progress there, having started only 2 years ago, through a combination of acquiring land sites and undertaking our own development, through funding -- forward funding local partners' projects and also buying some income-producing assets largely through customer relationships that we've got elsewhere in the group
  -0.11  1 We now own 9 assets, and we're well on track to have AUM in Spain of in excess of EUR 300 million in the near future
   0.00  1 Delivering sustainable returns also isn't just about building or buying modern warehouses in strong locations
   0.00  1 It's also important to own very generic buildings that are highly flexible and appeal to a wide range of occupier types, which is something that we've been very focused on
  -0.06  0 And we're also seeking to minimize carbon consumption through the development process, firstly by minimizing waste and reusing as much of an existing building as we can but also by using more sustainable materials, as we did in Paris where we made the roof beams out of laminated wood
   0.00  1 With customers often investing massively now in automated systems and tech inside the buildings, we've been future-proofing our developments with power upgrades
   0.00 -1 Our vacancy rate is, again, the lowest it's ever been at just 4%, or in fact 3.4% if you strip out recently completed spec developments
   0.00  1 And the uplift in rent reviews -- in rents from reviews and renewals is almost 10%, capturing some of the reversion that we've been building up in recent years
   0.00  1 We're now consistently generating growth in net income from our existing, standing assets
  -0.09  0 And as you can see from the bars on the first chart, most of that revenue growth is coming from development, so let me provide a little more color on that
   0.00  1 Last year, we completed 35 developments, producing 650,000 square meters of space, which is again by some margin a record in terms of volume
   0.00  1 The overall development yields on total costs including the land was over 8%
  -0.12  0 As always, we provide space to a very diverse range of customers spread across lots of geographies and with big boxes and urban
   0.00  1 The parcel delivery partners of these online retailers have also continued to be very active, particularly now as the battle for last-mile delivery hops up
  -0.06  1 And we've seen good demand from discount grocers and from traditional retailers seeking to respond to the online challenge and also from data center operators as the demand for cloud computing services continues to [ boon
   0.00  1 The low-growth, low interest rate environment that we've become accustomed to is just fine from our perspective
   0.00 -1 Whilst the general trajectory of interest rates is upwards from here and there are clearly wider concerns about the effects of Brexit, I don't believe that these will significantly impact demand for our type of space
   0.00  1 That's because the e-commerce revolution is well established and ongoing
   0.00  1 It -- and it remains a powerful driver of demand both for big box warehouses and urban warehouses both here in the U.K
   0.00  1 and increasingly now on the continent, there's definitely been a pickup in sentiment
   0.00 -1 Meanwhile, as these charts show you, the supply situation remains relatively constrained
   0.00  1 So I think 2018 looks like being a good year in the U.K
   0.08  0 And in terms of development and construction right across Europe, you can see from the charts at the bottom, there's still only a modest amount of spec development in the U.K
  -0.10  0 And elsewhere across Europe, volumes of build are similar to a year ago, but again and particularly emphasized by the red part of those bars, it's mostly preleased
   0.00 -1 In these urban locations, a meaningful supply response just isn't possible in most of them
   0.33  0 The market rates have stabilized
   0.00  1 And if anything, incented packages are now starting to come back in, which is a good sign, but regardless of future ERV growth across the portfolio, even at today's market rents, our portfolio is now GBP 25 million under rented, so the prospects for growing income and value from our standing assets are good
   0.00  1 But that said, it's the development pipeline that remains the real differentiator for SEGRO
   0.10  0 We have some terrific pre-lets under construction, including 2 on sites acquired through our partnership with the Greater London Authority in East London, 2 data centers, 4 warehouses for online retailers and 3 high-value uses in the form of budget hotels
  -0.14  0 As always, though, we have a large number of further pre-lets in solicitors' hands; or in some cases already signed and agreed, subject to a planning consent
  -0.33  0 You can also see the estimated breakdown of the annualized rent by geography, which is shown in the bar across the bottom of the page
   0.00  1 And of course, the yield on incremental capital from here on land that we already own is well north of 10%
   0.07  0 And although 1 or 2 of the sites, as you can see from the final column of the table, 1 or 2 of the sites, could keep us busy for the best part of a decade, the current rate of progress of our overall development program could see us work through most of this land bank in a 4- or 5-year period
   0.00  1 We've got the potential to increase cash-passing rents by over GBP 300 million, almost double our current rent roll
   0.08  0 There's around GBP 140 million of additional rent available from our current portfolio and the development projects which are either underway or in advanced discussions
  -0.05  0 And whilst this chart doesn't allow for the fact that we expect to continue disposing of assets around the edges of our core portfolio, it equally doesn't include any indexation or further market-driven rental growth
  -0.08  1 With low vacancy rates in all markets, limited speculative supply and significant constraints to new sites being brought through, there are good prospects for further rental growth
   1.00  0 Three for me, please
  -0.25  0 Or is that almost more of a marketing ploy?  Good questions, right
  -0.33  0 So I like those tough questions
   0.50  0 And it depends whether we draw in euros or sterling
   0.00  1 So the growth in cargo volume has been good, Mike
   0.00  1 And we have got our Sandringham estate, which is the second part of the cargo center, full for the first time actually, so we had a couple of really good deals this year
   0.00  1 So all going pretty well
   0.00  1 So it does have a reasonable return, but it's a really nice way of helping customers with their sustainability credentials as well as our own
  -0.12  0 It's quite a lot, but then probably Tesla is a bigger consumer of electric power than most people would be
   0.00  1 I mean, all the cargo facilities are pretty well chockablock on the back of some good export volumes
  -1.00  0 And 3 question from my side as well
  -0.17  0 So if we can have just a kind of size of order of this GBP 630 million net of disposals
   0.00  1 And it was triple that in H2, so we had some very good uplifts in rental levels in the second half
   0.00  1 Continental Europe was more balanced first half and second half
   0.10  0 In Continental Europe, what we -- what you're seeing, and it depends whether you're looking at like-for-likes, so whether you're looking at ERV
  -0.17  0 Now your question is, so why doesn't that flow through into the like-for- likes
   0.12  0 So they're indexed according to some kind of inflational construction cost metric
  -0.20  0 And then when you have a break or expiry, the tenant has an opportunity to renegotiate
   0.00 -1 And if the market rent hasn't driven their rebates back down
   0.00  1 But the good news is that with strong growth, I think, in the U.K
   0.12  0 adding to that reversion and then Continental Europe now in positive territory, you should start to see that reverse, anyway
  -0.50  0 So I hope that answers the question
  -0.11  0 But the guidance we've given is, we're around about GBP 200 million of disposals as a normal annual run rate that we would expect
  -0.17  0 We did all the big disposal programs, all the big reshaping of the portfolio
  -0.33  0 Mars make chocolate bars
  -0.19  0 So I don't -- we have this phrase, "Internet trumps Brexit." I think, as far as our portfolio is concerned, we think the forces, the structural drivers are much more important than any broad concerns around Brexit
  -0.12  0 I mean it looks like there's been quite a lot of inflation in land, particularly in the second half of the year
   0.00  1 And I think it's very important that, for us as a business, we remain as disciplined over land as we have done over buying investment products
   0.08  0 Are you at all tempted to come to the market with prime product given the strength of the bid that we see out there?  I'll let Phil answer, tell you whether he's tempted
   0.00 -1 So in SELP, we sold in 2017 some stuff in France that was -- that we thought was a little bit less core, wasn't going to perform as much
   0.00  1 And I've got to say, I mean, 2018 has started pretty strongly in the capital markets in industrial sector, so we're certainly expecting some good evidence to come through
   0.08  0 But for our really prime stuff, I mean, it's -- we're not really looking to sort of trade out of that stuff and sort of take advantage
   0.00 -1 We see these as really long-term anchors for us, mainly because they're irreplaceable
   0.00 -1 Some of our assets now are really so good that we would struggle to reinvest when we felt the time was right to do it
   0.00  1 And also, they're still performing very strongly because the rental growth that they're generating is higher than we're getting on -- in other parts of the market
  -0.12  1  I mean, I'm really pleased that we got rid of all the stuff that would have been problematic, would be problematic
  -0.08  0 It's a great market to be selling anything that's got any kind of a doubt or concern around its future performance, so we'll be thinking hard about that
   0.00 -1 I guess, just picking up some of the comments there about the capital markets; and an earlier comment that you made, David, about you wouldn't be surprised to see further yield compression
   0.00  1 Well, mainly it's based on the very strong fundamentals that are in the market
  -0.09  0 I mean, I think -- reading the press in 2017, I don't think a month went by without some new vehicle being set up targeting to get into the industrial markets
   0.20  0 So there's still plenty of money looking to deploy into the sector
   0.00 -1 So I mean, if you're being very conservative, that's a lot of support for current pricing that that'll probably mean in certain markets we're going to see some further yield compression
  -0.25  1 So I think 2018 will still be pretty good, but I -- maybe not quite as strong as 2017
   0.00 -1 I mean, there were some -- the big platform deals that happened in 2017 that sort of put the yields down, obviously not going to be happening again in 2018
   0.00  1 But it's going to be pretty good, I would have thought, yes
  -0.12  0  Is the -- I'm asking the question now, is the Continental Europe different to the U.K.?  Yes
  -0.17  0 I mean some markets in Continental Europe that you could argue are slightly behind where the U.K
  -0.12  0 And slowly but surely, as Phil talked about, every month, there's some new investor or fund that's been announced
  -0.20  0 Capital all around the world, slowly but surely, is waking up to that
  -0.25  0    That brings me nicely on to my last question
   0.05  0 If you're expecting that in the medium term, can we see a progression in the portfolio?  I think you will see over time that we will be looking to increase our deployment of capital into urban warehousing in a lot more cities than we're currently in -- or sorry, a lot more scale than we currently have in a number of those, about 12 or 15 cities across Europe that we'd like to do this in
  -0.50  0 and Paris; demolish it; build something new
  -0.09  0 And that takes time relative to big boxes where there's more stock around and you can deploy larger chunks of capital quite quickly
  -0.07  0 So if a site becomes available, if it's designated as industrial -- strategic industrial land, it's very risky for a residential developer to buy it thinking that they can convert it to residential
  -0.05  0 It's something that we're very much trying to engage with local authorities with -- on and to say that, "You're going to create a problem for yourselves if you don't provide local jobs and space to make the city work," but it means it's a long, hard process
   0.00  1 So we're very committed to it
   0.00  1 Just intrigued, a very high lease retention rate at the moment
  -0.14  0 So I'm wondering if you can give a few examples if it's not commercially insensitive
  -0.07  1 We're always working with them, but yes, it's pretty good for us at the moment because, as you saw from the slides, the lack of supply is clearly, frankly, making people sticky
   0.00  1 We like to think we are doing pretty well with customers as well
   0.00  1 So we are seeing -- on regears, renewals and reviews, you saw from David's stats some really significant uplifts in London over the period
   0.00 -1 So sorry about that
   1.00  0 But so we are seeing progression
  -0.09  0 We're looking for value, as opposed to, in the past, we've been, particularly on the vacancy side, letting to fill up
  -0.07  1 I mean, because it's a listed company, Marc, you'll appreciate we're quite limited in what we can say, but we're very pleased we've bought a stake in the company
   0.00  1 We like the asset
  -1.00  0 Press the button
   0.00  1  Good, okay
  -0.25  0 It answers any question I could conceivably ask
   0.00  1 Everything looks perfectly excellent and justifies the capital that's been put in by shareholders in recent years, so I'll ask a   saucy question
   0.00 -1 Because they've been fighting landlords for years, of course
  -0.14  0 So just in case I put my foot wrong, I'm going to pass over to our Amazon key account director, who is Andy Gulliford
  -0.33  0 And he will answer the question as diplomatically as he can
   0.00  1  I was really hopeful that, as you were taking that, you were going to stay with it
  -0.12  1 And I certainly wouldn't want to upset what is now our second largest customer and growing rapidly
   0.20  0 But we are, Keith, very aware of the covenant strength, not just with Amazon but generally
   0.00  1 They tend to have a structure which provides a European covenant which is extremely good
  -0.20  0 If not, then thank you all very much for your questions and for coming on this morning
    nan  1 And have a good day

   0.00  1                                                          So good morning, everyone
   0.20  0 It's been my pleasure to have worked alongside David over 25 years and as his CFO for the last 11 years
   0.00 -1 On a more somber note, we sadly lost Mike Wilson yesterday, one of our founders and the inspiration behind St
   0.00  1  Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone
  -0.02  0 The areas that I plan to cover therefore this morning are: firstly, a recap on the new business announcement that we made back in January; the cash result, which shows the way in which cash has emerged within the group over the past year and the embedded value result, which views the group on a net present value basis, excluding, of course, new business, so that's just based on an existing business basis; I'll also make some comments on solvency; and finally, on the dividend
   0.19  0 You may find the approach I take in presentation is different to your experience in the past, but please do rest assured that the information you're used to seeing and receiving is in the pack if I don't cover it in my presentation
   0.00  1 This, coupled with very strong retention, saw net inflows grow by 40% to GBP 9.5 billion
   0.00  1 So given the long-term nature of our business and the emergence of shareholder value over time, it goes without saying that the growth in both funds under management and adviser numbers that we've already reported bodes very well for the future
   0.00  1 The strong growth in funds under management is reflected in a 22% increase in net annual management fees
  -0.17  0 Following on from this, we then see a couple of impacts from the investment contracts liability reassessment that we reported last year, and as a reminder, this was a change to the estimates of fair values to get the contract values down to the encashment value and that's the approach that's consistent with IFRS and Solvency II
   0.06  0 The results as we said at that time is entirely neutral for embedded value and for IFRS, but the impact on cash was to bring forward a cumulative emergence of GBP 267 million into last year's closing cash balance sheet position
   0.12  0 And this was cash that would have otherwise emerged over the following 6 years, which has the effect of increasing the reduction for fees and gestations throughout the remainder of that period
   0.00  1 The number which for 2017 was GBP 266 million will, of course, continue to grow as we grow our funds under management and it serves as a very clear indicator of future cash emergence
   0.00  1 On the flip side, the same mechanism has contributed to a significant increase in new business cash flows because of this earlier cash emergence
  -0.06  1 Overall, expenses have moved very much in the way that you would expect them to given the significant growth that we experienced during the course of the year, but it is worth noting that our contribution to FSCS has increased to a net figure of GBP 17 million, which is at a pretty frustrating high level
   0.00 -1 As you would expect, we've participated in recent consultations on FSCS cost, but at this point in time, I'm afraid we see very little light at the end of this particular tunnel
  -0.12  0 As you can see, there's been little movement to speak of in either shareholder interest or tax relief from capital losses
  -0.09  0 But one point to note here is that we have GBP 86 million of capital losses available for future relief that we expect to be utilized more or less evenly over the next 8 years
   0.00  1 Our operating cash results, taking account of all of this, was 39% up at GBP 315.2 million
   0.33  0 We continue to invest in the Academy, which goes from strength to strength
   0.09  0 The valuable contribution that it's now making means that now is the right time to move it into operating cash for future reporting periods
   0.00  1 We expect the results -- sorry, we expect the cash result of Rowan Dartington and Asia to remain broadly consistent in 2018, and what this means is future increased revenues will be funding future investment cost
   0.00  1 All of this results in an underlying cash result of GBP 281.2 million, which represents an increase of 41% compared to 2016
   0.00  1 Firstly, and most significantly, it reflects the strong growth in gross inflows of 29% that I've already mentioned
   0.00  1 It also reflects increased operational leverage together with an embedded value benefit of our new retirement account, which incorporates the investments in drawdown period into the same contract boundary
  -0.17  0 Under EEV rules, this results in a longer expected life for the contract
  -0.10  0 There are no plans to change existing contracts, and therefore, this unrecorded value remains outside of our EEV results and balance sheet
   0.00  1 2017 also saw positive net operating assumption changes of GBP 44 million, largely attributable to taking into account continued strong persistency across-the-board
  -0.20  0 Now a brief comment on capital and solvency
  -0.14  0 Last year, we explained that we'd be carrying out a review about management solvency buffer or MSB
   0.00  1 Importantly, our solvency position remains very strong
   0.00  1 At the half year, we announced an increase in the interim dividend of 25%
   0.00  1 This results in a year-on-year growth of 30%
   0.00  1 Our growth in funds under management has contributed to an underlying cash result, which is 41% up on last year, and a gestation balance of GBP 31 billion, which, as we stand here now, has already started to contribute to future results
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1 So I'd like to   thank our partners, their advisers and support teams, our employees and everyone in our administration teams who made these results possible
   0.00  1 I'd also like to thank our clients for entrusting us with their investments
   0.00  1 James's Place partnership, a service which is valued by clients and a business that is performing well
   0.00  1 And together with our strong retention of client investments and a modicum of market growth, this will translate into funds under management, and consequently, underlying cash growing at the same rate and this, in turn, should deliver similar growth in the dividend
   0.00  1 Firstly, the marketplace for trustworthy, face-to-face advice is already large, has grown and is forecast to grow still further, supported by favorable demographic trends and the needs for individuals to accumulate and protect their investments in an ever-more complex financial environment
   0.00  1 Our target market, that's individuals with investable wealth of between GBP 50,000 and GBP 5 million, currently numbers some 10.5 million, a figure that is projected to grow to over 12 million by 2021
   0.00  1 These individuals control wealth of GBP 2.2 trillion today, which will grow to around GBP 2.5 trillion over the same period
   0.00  1 Now we currently have some 3% to 4% of this addressable market, so there remains significant headroom for further gains in market share
   0.06  0 In addition, there's a continued switch in responsibility for retirement provision from a combination of state and employer responsibility to one of individual responsibility, which has been accompanied by greater choice and complexity
  -0.06  1 Increasingly, as our results show, people are looking for an adviser they can trust, an adviser who will take the financial stress out of their lives, and importantly, an adviser that is supported and backed by financially sound organization with a strong reputation and proposition
   0.14  0 Now despite this strong and growing market for advice, there are not enough financial advisers in the U.K
   0.00 -1 Since then, the number has reduced as, first, Life companies and then banks withdrew from the market
   0.00 -1 In recent years, there has been a welcome increase in professionalism within the adviser community, but it has been accompanied by further reduction in the number of qualified advisers to the current 30,000 to 35,000
   0.00 -1   And a final point to make on the adviser market is that, given the qualifications required, the regulatory burden and the long payback period for any investment in this area, there are considerable barriers to entry and perhaps this is why we're not seeing new entrants
   0.00  1 So the size of the market is large and growing with a considerable savings gap that needs to be bridged
   0.05  0 The need and demand for trusted face-to-face advice has never been greater whilst, at the same time, the number of qualified advisers is insufficient creating an advice gap, the perfect environment for client- focused advice business like ours
   0.00  1 With our focus on developing long-term relationships that span client generations, our partners can provide a level of tailored and expert advice that clients truly value
  -0.08  1 In addition, we have no in-house investment management, so we have no conflict of interest, which ensures our clients can feel safe in the knowledge we will look after their investment they entrusted us
   0.00  1 The breadth of our proposition is growing and means that our clients have well-diversified portfolios, spreading their investment risk and consistently delivering good returns compared to their -- our peer group's over 1 year, as you can see on the current slide, but also over 5 years
  -0.04  0 This includes the due diligence we employ to ensure we avoid unsuitable, complex and toxic products, which keep our client asset safe and free of unnecessary risk; the technical support that stands behind our partners' advice, be it pensions, tax or trust planning
  -0.12  0 We then quality check some 35,000 cases a year to ensure the advice was correct, and consequently, we guarantee the advice
   0.14  0 Our succession planning for partners means our clients have the peace of mind that they have support and service over the years and we will always be by their side
   0.00  1 This provides our clients with a significant source of comfort and value
   0.08  0 The mention of value leads me conveniently to one other topic I would like to touch on today, which relates to cost and value
   0.00  1 There's a very important point to understand here: our business is focused on delivering good client outcomes
   0.00  1 Our partners start by understanding a client's goals and objectives from which they can design a personalized, tax- efficient financial plan, utilizing an investment strategy to meet these needs and ensuring clients optimize the tax reliefs available to them, which we refer to as tax alpha
  -0.17  1 In addition, partners help clients build diversified portfolios to mitigate the impact on their wealth from shocks and then they help them during market downturns to help avoid selling at a loss
  -0.17  0 It's a very personal calculation, reflecting specific circumstances and personal objectives
   0.05  0 Interestingly, the FCA's Financial Lives Surveys, an extensive data collection of exercise, which cover interviews of over 12,000 individuals, provided an analysis of value, satisfaction and trust with regards to financial advice and robo-advice
  -0.12  0 The results were quite revealing and highlighted that low cost does not necessarily represent value for money
   0.00  1 This will result in both growing funds under management and a growing cash result, which will translate into future dividend growth
   0.10  0 We've seen considerable regulatory change come into effect from the start of this year in the form of MiFID II and PRIIPs
  -0.14  0 However, insofar as Brexit is concerned, we are relatively immune from the outcomes of trade negotiations
   0.10  0 Continuation of the journey to complete our back office infrastructure program, which will enable us to consolidate our U.K
   0.00  1 administration onto a single client-centric platform to deliver a more holistic service to our clients whilst leveraging modern technology
   0.00  1 We also continue to build on the ongoing evolution of our investment management approach to ensure we provide both ongoing strong investment returns to clients and that we have sufficient capacity for our journey to GBP 200 billion of funds under management
   0.00  1 We will also continue the development of Rowan Dartington, which will see a further increase in the 46 investment executives and further strong growth in the current GBP 2.1 billion of funds under management
   0.00  1 A record year in many respects
   0.00  1 This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver sustained growth in line with our stated medium-term objective of 15% to 20% per annum
  -0.50  0 There's a question down
  -1.00  0 We should do this question here
   0.00 -1 The first one was on regulation and MiFID, you obviously mentioned this had some impact
  -0.08  0 I suppose one of the areas is that I expect fees now need to be disclosed, I believe, on an absolute basis while than just on a percentage terms
   0.25  0 I'd just be interested in some feedback around that, please
  -0.22  0 Second one was just on solvency and the management solvency buffer for, it's really just a point of clarification
   0.08  0 And the third one is on the DB pension transfer market, just curious for an update there, please, as to kind of the contributions to your pension flows and business from that
   0.00 -1 Obviously, there's been a lot of noise around mis-selling practices and so on
  -0.33  0 Craig, do you want to take the solvency
  -0.17  0 And then, David, maybe you take the MiFID and DB transfer question
  -0.22  0 The reality is that MSB and capital is subject to constant reassessment not just in the Life bit of the group, but elsewhere within the group
   0.00 -1 And DB transfers, a lot of   noise about it
   0.00  1 The select monitor change of assessing fund managers is continuous, it's real, and it's robust and it's served us very well over the years
  -0.07  0 And therefore, these migrations, you wouldn't say necessarily twice the complexity, but they're certainly far more sizable and more complicated than they would have been at the very early planning stages
  -0.11  1 And what we're doing is setting ourselves a time frame where we can do it, do it in the right way and do it in a way that gives us the results that we need without having adverse impacts
   0.00 -1 It's below the underlying cash results that's not a dividend point
  -0.25  0 I think your other question was around of relationship?  Yes
   0.00  1  We have a very strong relationship with DST
   0.08  0 But what we know is that we represent a large proportion of the combined entities' revenue and profit, so I'm sure we'll get on fine
  -0.08  0  He said that if that didn't -- if that had an adverse outcome that you would look to take it over, is that more likely, the sales?  I'm not sure any of us have actually said that
   0.00  1 Firstly, just on the margins, there's always been a very strong pickup in the new business contribution from embedded value from the lower admin costs
  -0.12  0 Secondly, on solvency, and I appreciate we've touched on this a little bit already
  -0.07  1 The Life insurance entity solvency has come down to 111% and it's come down on average by about 15 percentage points per annum and that's reflecting the very strong growth in the business
   0.12  0 Or is the focus very much in terms of building out the existing expansion and continuing that strong progress?  Okay
  -0.33  0 Craig, do you want to take the solvency and the margin question?    Yes
   0.11  0 Taking the effect of Bluedoor first, the area where you see that the most clearly is within the embedded value results clearly because the embedded value account takes account of the full position posts dual running costs
  -0.15  0 On the solvency point, I think the best way for me to approach the question is to think of it in terms of how comfortable are we and what is our view on 110% of standard formula
  -0.12  0 As we discussed in the past, it's very difficult to make comparison between SJP and the statistics that flow from any kind of Solvency II modeling and any other kind of insurance business certainly that I can think of
   0.00  1 But the majority of what we hold as capital, when you look at it from an MSB perspective, will grow as the business grows
  -0.33  0  I think there was another question down just in front, from Andrew
  -0.50  0 Three questions, as usual
  -0.25  0 Yes, I'll do the productivity question first
   0.00  1 So the professionalization of the businesses has led to increased productivity, but also the environment they're operating in, in terms of the need for advice
   0.00  1 So I've often said a lot of our partners are as busy as they want to be at the moment because of the high demand from the preretirement, at-retirement, postretirement generation
  -0.12  0 In terms of recruitment, we're not seeing any major competition from the banks threatening to recruit our people or being in the frame at the moment for the same potential people
  -0.06  1 The banks have got a track record of dipping into this market, failing at it, dipping out, going back in and a kind of cycle whereas I think we can offer a proposition to potential recruits of longevity of their career
   0.00  1 So I think if we come into those situations either/or, I think we're well placed to do well
  -0.17  0 So at the moment, we're not feeling under any threat from that part of the market
  -0.12  0    On the Bluedoor question, there's lots of -- sort of parts of the program
  -0.25  0 I think I saw another question over here firstly so
  -0.33  0 I've just got 2 questions
   0.00  1 The first one on the dividend, increasing the guidance in the payout to 80%
   0.50  0 We have the distributable profits
   0.00  1 So last year, we introduced a new probate service as part of what we do with client servicing and that's beginning to prove really helpful to both generations in terms of not just at the moment, but planning ahead for that moment
  -0.11  0 Actually, that's quite a simple way of showing intergenerational planning at a very practical level
   0.00  1 And that's an area we think is definitely one for growth for us in terms of our proposition going forward
   0.05  0 The tax changes and the pensions freedom mean actually an awful lot of more conversations around what's the most efficient way of doing that conversation, how do you protect some of those assets in that journey going from accumulation to decumulation and what sort of tools you need both to give advice as well as the investment proposition needs alongside that
   0.00  1 The Next Generation Academy, a different word, is going back to our Academy and people development, is a lot of our partner businesses are very keen to grow their own support services and advisers and we've got a Next Generation Academy that brings family members or people they want us to train on their behalf who take a place within that small business, either to go on a journey of administrator, paraplanner, eventual adviser or to go straight in as an adviser and that's been very successful for us, helping us to support and build the infrastructure in those businesses, which actually has, to go back to the question right at the beginning, had the -- one of the impacts and one of the drivers on increased productivity in the businesses
  -0.33  0  So I think there's a question from Ben there
  -0.14  0 I've got another question on capital, I'm afraid
  -0.12  0 In the commentary this morning on the solvency buffer, I think you've been quite clear about holding capital on the Life company to match the MSB
  -0.12  0 But I don't think you've been quite so clear about the -- sort of the other third column in direct
   0.17  0 So I was just wondering what you think about the appropriate level of surplus there and also whether or not you'd to be happy to see the number that you've got in terms of overall group coverage of about 240% continuing to kind of go up?  Yes, please, please
  -0.14  0 But to pick up all of the other regulated entities, we go through a constant monitoring process and an annual reassessment process
  -0.11  0    What I used to always say with my old hat on is we won't hold on to capital unnecessarily
  -0.33  0 I think there's a few more questions down this side
  -0.20  0  So question, firstly, on European embedded value
   0.00  1 Or is 3% to 6% a really good guide for us?  I'm going to go with 3% to 6% very quickly because I see Peter Edwards at the back there who's responsible for this smiling
   0.00  1 6% to 8% growth in advisers
  -0.03  0 And therefore, on the EEV, in order to make sure we're consistent because I think that's the value at an embedded value approach, we've applied the same rule set that we always would have applied and that involves taking account of the entire contract length, which clearly means, as you suggest, there's a longer period for embedded value to emerge at the points at which it's originated
  -0.33  0   I think there were 2 questions in front of you
  -0.10  0 Just 2 questions, the first would be a follow-up on Rowan Dartington, GBP 2 billion -- above GBP 2 billion of FUM guiding to revenue and costs going up next year
   0.00  1 So RD, as a stand-alone business, if we stopped investing in it and expanding it across the U.K., it would make a positive contribution to the cash result
   0.00  1 So they make a reasonable -- a very decent contribution to the net growth in manpower
  -0.20  0 And then I think Barrie's desperate to ask a question
  -0.33  0  I think my question has been asked
  -0.08  0 But the other question I had was more just in terms of the foundation, I think you double-matched contribution, it's a small point, but I think it's really worthwhile
  -0.04  0 Just a question on the productivity of Academy numbers relative to your overall partnership and to other new recruits, if you've got sort of a time line, presumably they take some time to build  Iain?  Yes, like all new businesses, it takes time to build up the kind of productivity over a 3 -- after about 3 years, 3.5 years
   0.00  1 One of the things that's pleasing is that an increasing number of our Academy graduates, instead of going to build stand-alone businesses, which can be quite lonely and hard work, are finding homes within existing businesses and that's one of the reasons they get to be more productive quicker because they're in an existing business with a mentor, with access to clients and within a kind of framework that increases their ability to be productive earlier
  -0.14  0 So I think one last question, I saw a hand go up a few times in the middle there, so we'll take that
  -1.00  0 Just one question
   0.00 -1 And I've always said that when we're fully on Bluedoor, we would expect that tariff to come down by double-digit percentages
  -0.17  0 Okay, one final question, if I may, from Eamonn and then we'll bring it to a close
  -0.50  0 It's not a question
   0.11  0 I wondered if, on behalf of the sell-side, you could pass on our sincere sympathy and best wishes to the family of Mike Wilson, please
   0.00  1 Certainly, at a personal level, Mike was a wonderful man, terrific mentor and a good friend of the sell-side
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.25  0 We're around for coffees and teas afterward, so please do mingle
   0.00  1 Thank you very much

---FILE: Standard Chartered PLC.txt

   0.17  0 Everyone, thanks very much for joining us at a slightly earlier time for us, but pleasure to have you all here
   0.00  1 We have clearly demonstrated that the foundations are secure
   0.00  1 Our underlying infrastructure, our risk and management controls, our capital base are in good shape
   0.00  1 We're now poised for growth
   0.00  1 This is a milestone that we intend to hit on our way to a full cost of capital plus return
   0.00  1 I think a number of people have, but perhaps what feels good about our performance at Standard Chartered is that it's very broad-based
   0.00  1 So every one of our products, every one of our regions has shown good growth year-on-year
   0.00  1 And across the group, it's been double-digit year-on-year income growth
   0.00  1 As we got into 2016, we had the beginning in 2016 into 2017 at the beginning of real underlying business momentum and business growth of net-net $400 million
   0.00 -1 Though we can't let that take away from the underlying business momentum that we are demonstrating now that we're through with this period of more substantial business exits and de- risking
   0.00  1 These are our growth engines for some time to come, and these are good businesses to begin with: Transaction Banking, Wealth Management, mortgage and autos, and then the, really the entire liability side of our balance sheet, so our deposit franchise
   0.00  1 A little bit over half of the income of the bank grew 13% year-over-year, and that obviously continued through to the second half with a 6% increase half-over-half
  -0.06  0 The third buckets are the areas that are much more external market related, where we can expect period- to-period volatility that is the function of the external environment, financial Markets most obviously, but also treasury and other related things
   0.00 -1 Clearly had a poor second half of last year and then a less poor, but still poor overall year in Financial Markets
   0.00 -1 We're down 7% year-on-year, down 21% in the second half
   0.00  1 Equally, obviously, from my earlier comment, we had a good start to 2018
  -0.20  0 And I suspect we will be out of line with the same in Financial Markets in the first part of this year
   0.00  1 We think we can grow this business
   0.00  1 We are committed to delivering a sustainably higher return on equity
   0.00  1 We've made good progress from negative ROEs to 3.5% in the last year, and we intend to continue to drive that through to 8% and then beyond
   0.00  1 We've been very good at taking expenses out
  -0.08  1 This is Standard Chartered Bank that we're talking about, with cutting-edge technology, delivered in a seamless way, and it seems to be working, customers really appreciate this
   0.00  1 In many cases, we're best-in-class in the markets in which we serve for customer service, that's what NPS is ultimately measuring
   0.00  1 Finally, and I'll talk about this a bit later, investing heavily in people in order to really drive the performance culture that is critical to our long-term success
   0.17 -1 As you have all noted and is clearly true, we can only accomplish this with substantial income growth
  -0.20  0 And with that, I'll hand it over to Andy and come back at the end with some more comments and questions
    nan  1  Good
   0.00  1 Well, thank you very much, Bill
   0.00 -1 The fourth quarter, as some of you'll have noticed, the income was slightly lower than in the third quarter
  -0.08  1 2 or 3 moving parts in there: strong Corporate Finance performance in the fourth quarter, weak Financial Markets performance in the fourth quarter, those 2 sort of broadly offset each other
   0.09  0 And on the Wealth Management side, the full year bonus for VAT, as we mentioned last time, we actually achieved by the end of the third quarter
   0.00  1 So if you adjust for that, we are 71% up on a like-for-like basis
  -0.25  0 Restructuring, another $350 million of charges, so that takes us to about the $3 billion level now
   0.33  0 And overall statutory profit at $2.4 billion
  -0.09  0 Below the line, not on this chart, in the tax charge of $1.1 billion, there is a $200 million deferred tax write-off to do with the recent changes in the U.S
   0.09 -1 So the underlying effective tax rate, excluding the non-underlying item is about 32%, which is below where we were previously, and we hope to get that down further over time
   0.00  1 Down at the bottom, the CET1 ratio, 13.6%, in fact, at both period ends, so a good space on that front
  -0.05  0   On IFRS 9 and Basel III, I will touch upon both of those in the future slide, but I think, with both of them, there is now clarity or quite a lot more clarity, and we remain pretty comfortable that those are manageable as we move forward, but I'll come onto those in a later slide
   0.00 -1 In green, all things that went well, and in gray, things which went less well
   0.00  1 So things that went well, Transaction Banking, a very strong performance, 18% up on income over the period
   0.00  1 Wealth Management also very, very strong, and good performances in treasury and on the deposit front
   0.06  0 And I'd probably pull out 2 things there: slightly higher variable compensation, given the high level of profit; and secondly, slightly higher depreciation on ships and aircraft that we lease
   0.00  1 The regulatory cost, as I mentioned earlier, are up, so up to $1.3 billion, with a large number of big regulatory programs, landing in the year, and we would hope that, that number will moderate slightly as we go forwards
   0.00  1 And then on the bank levy, we have got a quite significant reduction there, about $100 million, as we have gone through in more granular detail some of the netting, and that has given us a benefit, which has clearly come through in 2017 year, albeit, because it is mostly impacted 2016
  -0.11  0 On the bottom left, you can see the chart that takes us through the 4-year commitment of late 2015 on over gross cost take out
   0.10  0 I think all of you will be familiar with the fact that we said that we needed to invest a lot more in the business to improve the fabric of it
  -0.14  0 And I think it's not actually just the heights of the bars on the left
   0.00  1 That is now coming through, which I think is good to see
   0.00 -1 The turnaround time for onboarding new corporate clients is reduced by 2/3 over the last 2 years
  -0.50  0 So change of topic, loan impairments
  -0.14  1 And as the early alerts can be a feeder into the other areas, that is good, I think to be stemming that flow much earlier
   0.00 -1 Cover ratio is slightly down
   0.20  0 That is just the mix of the accounts that we have resolved versus ones we've taken up
  -0.12  0 But more importantly, when you take collateral into account, we are actually up on cover on the nonperforming loans
  -0.50  0 Nonperforming loans being about 2.3% of the ongoing book now
  -0.20  0 Just one other thing maybe to highlight, it's not quite so visible here
  -0.17  0 And then, finally, the slide on the bottom right, liquidation portfolio
   0.00  1 But you can see on the bottom right chart, that's the same sort of seems pretty this to be volumes up across all the product ranges
   0.00  1 Bottom left here, on balance sheet, momentum, the overall increase in customer accounts
   0.00  1 So about $30 billion or so more deposits and a very good mix of those deposits, so very much the more sticky accounts for us
   0.00  1 In terms of customer loans, those are up 12%, which is 89% on a constant FX basis, and so up about $30 billion over that period of time, and again, fairly broad-based
   0.06  0 What I think is interesting, that is, on the top right, if you look at where the new accounts are in terms of risk profile, the whole of that $30 billion is in the better risk categories, categories 1 to 5, with the categories above that, essentially being flat year-on-year
   0.22  0 So about 45 bps of profit that's generated, sort of CET 1 generation of 45 bps from profit
   0.17  0 There is a corporate one, but I don't think the effect of that will be anything likely significant
   0.10  0 On IFRS 9, we had indicated previously, we thought this whole impact of that will be between 10 and 20 basis points of CET1 effect
   0.11  0 But because some of that had already been taken into account in the regulatory calculations, the effect is more muted on the regulatory front
   0.17  0 And because there has been a transition arrangement, actually, the year 1 impact of this we think will be incredibly small
  -0.25  0 And Basel III, more clarity on that late last year
  -0.12  0 Also, a little bit difficult to be entirely precise, as most banks are pointing out, there is still a fair amount of national   discretionary that is allowed
   0.00  1 So Corporate and Institutional banking, top line flat, that is the story of the Financial Markets weighing down, as I've referred to earlier, but a very strong performance on Transaction Banking, which has pretty much offset it
  -0.09  0 The business, Simon talked about in November, the intent is to be getting that into the 5% to 7% range on the top line growth, and that is where all of the energy is at this point in time
   0.00  1 Commercial Banking, 3% up on the top line
   0.00 -1 But I think, most noticeably, that business unit that essentially is only 2.5 years old, we have now turned from loss into profit
  -0.25  0 A big, big focus upon loan impairments
  -0.12  0 And as we go forwards, the big focus is upon growing, but growing the business thoughtfully, particularly from the loan impairment aspect
   0.00  1 So I think that is a big milestone
  -0.11  0 4% top line growth, albeit, we had 2 disposals retail businesses end of the period
  -0.07  0 And I'd say really the big push on retail now is digitalization and rolling out the platforms that we have been working on for quite a period of time
   0.00 -1 Private banking, top line, modest 1%
   0.00  1 So if you normalize that, it was up more like 6% to 7%
   0.11 -1 And underlying profits still held down by the amount of investment we're making in replatforming and upscaling in the business
   0.00  1 Assets under management grew during the period
   0.00  1 Net new money was up $2 billion during the year, so we are seeing a bit early momentum there, and obviously, it will take a while for that to fully flow through to the bottom line
   0.00  1 So 8% top line and 45% bottom line growth there
   0.00 -1 China, excluding the associate investment, returned to profit, having been slightly loss-making year before
    nan  1 Taiwan, Japan did well
   0.00  1 And clearly, whilst the momentum runs there, it's very helpful for the momentum across the whole of the business
   0.00 -1 So without that, we'd have been about 2% down
   0.00 -1 So that was the other thing that weighed down
   0.00  1 However, big focus in there, the rest of the businesses, I think, particularly in the retail commercial space, are going pretty well, and that remains a big area of focus
   0.00  1 So I think there are good things happening there, but clearly weighed back by a couple of factors last year
   0.00  1 If you do it on local currency basis, it was up 3%
   0.00  1 So I think some good progress there, obviously spanning really quite the number of territories
   0.00 -1 And then Europe and Americas is down 4% on income, but this is another area which probably took about $200 million of the reduction in the FM income, which weighed down on the numbers here
   0.00  1 Overall, actually, performance in Europe and Americas has been really good
   0.00  1 Obviously, a good business globally, in one way shape or form
   0.00  1 It's booked in other parts of the world was actually up 10% year-on-year
  -0.33  0 Quite a complex story here, because there've been quite a significant movements in the numbers
   0.00 -1 If I just briefly talk to the segment side, the previous year, a small loss, now a big profit
   0.00 -1 And it has been weighed down a bit by the hedge accounting adjustment as well
   0.10  0 So a sort of $1 billion top line business, if you like, income stream and probably ongoing profitability somewhere between the 2016, 2017 numbers
   0.00  1 I think we have been very consistent to what we set out in 2015 as we've been doing, and I think that has brought good focus within the business
   0.00 -1 The top line, obviously last year was more muted, but there was one particular product line that was behind that
   0.00  1 The regulatory clouds on IFRS 9 and Basel III are lifting, and hence, the dividend coming back
   0.00  1 And I think really the focus now from my perspective is about the income momentum, it's about continuing to simplify the business and really putting a focus on productivity
   0.17  0 Talked about the ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity
   0.00 -1 We will not lose track of the underlying risk and control progress that we've made so much of in the past couple of years
   0.20  0   Innovation and digitization, it's inherent in our business
  -0.50  0 The threats come from within and without
   0.00  1 And we think we've got a pretty good track record
   0.00  1 We need to shape that into a very good track record
  -0.25  0 The fight against financial crime is ongoing
  -0.20  1 If we've distinguished ourselves in terms of the contributions that we've made to making the banking environment a hostile place for criminals and bad doers to conduct their business, we'll continue to do that
  -0.09  0 We have legacy investigations relating to historical activities, as we've mentioned every time I've sit in front of you
  -0.50  0 Those investigations are ongoing
   0.00  1 A lot of that is going into technology, and we're seeing that, and when we're recognized as the best online bank or digital bank in Asia, and when we're the first- to-market in key South Asian and African markets with digital application
   0.00  1 We recognize that we're a desirable partner for some of the new entrants into this market, the e-commerce companies or financial technology companies
   0.00  1 That's not the threat, that's an opportunity for us
  -0.25  1 But there are threats out there for sure, and we think that we've got a pretty good plan for dealing with those threats
   0.00  1 And our track record in terms of delivering on the technology undertakings that we've embarked on are good
   0.17  0 We can't accomplish any of this without continuing to evolve the performance culture of our bank
  -0.05  1 But for us, we're spending a lot of time on taking what has historically been a strong performance culture at Standard Chartered, but which we're on off track as we transform the bank, as we went through a challenging transition, the bank turned inwards
  -0.09  0 We are shifting that very deliberately, and we've done that with extensive interaction with most of the 85,000 employees of the bank through extensive workshops, and listening session and things of that nature
  -0.20  1 This leveraging our unique diversity has a lot to do with the fact that it's not just our bank which is diverse, our 85,000 colleagues and 15,000 contractors, but our clients as well
  -0.20  0 And we don't want to lose that, in fact, we want to invest more in that diversity, which is unique to Standard Chartered
   0.00 -1 We're here for good, not good enough
   0.00  1 And it's resonating
   0.00  1 We think we can match the growth of those markets and exceed that growth
   0.00  1 We can become much more productive
   0.00  1 That's going to drive our returns
   0.00  1 It's going to allow us to cover our cost of capital and more in the years to come
  -0.25  0 I've got a couple of questions, if I can
  -0.06  0 And I guess my other just point of clarification on this is, I see we're talking ROE, not return on tangible equity in terms of what it refers to? And the second question was just on the dividend, which I see is very healthy, sort of reinstated today
   0.11  0 And we didn't want to give the impression that we were just upping our numbers courtesy of a redefinition of the base point
   0.17  0 We will look particularly where there are opportunities to invest and expand the business
   0.00  1 And to the extent that there is a good return, then we will seek to return a good number back to shareholders so that we keep that line moving up
  -0.10  0 Transaction Banking, clearly, the star of the show last year, and that was pretty much driven by cash management, and trade obviously quite subdued still
   0.00  1 So as you say, the overall is very strong
   0.00 -1 I think, on the trade side, first the volumes are up, but the margins are under a little bit of pressure
   0.00 -1 In Transaction Banking, the market has been subdued, for sure
   0.00 -1 Margin compression has been substantial
   0.00  1 We've maintained the overall share, but the proportion of the earnings that the primary trade bank actually gets from the trading relationships has increased significantly over that period
   0.00  1 So we're getting -- we're maintaining a strong -- a very strong #1 share in our core Asian markets with an increasing share of that wallet
   0.00  1 I think ex the levy, costs were about $225 million ahead of consensus, which if you look at Q4, I mean, is relatively bigger
   0.33  0 And I've got 2 others, please
   0.11  0 Is there anything you can add as to why that might be, or what you might be doing to address that one that might not repeat in 2018, it sounds like you're off to a better start?  Yes
   0.00 -1 But the real story is we reversed our Financial Markets management team over the course of last year
   0.00 -1 I'd also note that even with the subdued performance in 2017, it's still a high returning business for us relative to the rest of our portfolio
   0.11  0 Just on what you said on your dividend policy, you will have obviously an investment opportunity as an alternative
   0.00  1 So the 8% is clearly an important signpost on a journey
   0.00  1 I think it's very important motivation within the business
  -0.15  0 It is not a stopping point, we want to get a bit higher, and hence, your question would imply a slightly higher hurdle to things we're looking at now
  -0.10  0 So when it comes to new lending decisions, acquisitions, which obviously I made any divestitures which we have, we're looking against that benchmark
  -0.09  0 So as the decisions rolled through the portfolio over a period of time, we'll obviously drag to the 10%, or else a little bit smaller roughly, of course
  -0.30  0 So we've been quite deliberate about pacing the way that we effectively force the upgrade of our clients or the alternative forced exit
  -0.17  0 The first one is a little bit of broader questions, just in terms of U.S
   0.12  0 interest curve that probably we'd see a little less opportunity on the U.S
  -0.08  1  The second question I had is just to try to get a little bit more color to your strong start of the year guidance in terms of broad based double-digit comment
   0.14  0 I was just wondering if you could add a little bit more color on where the strength comes from
  -0.10  0 Last year, January and February were not bad, so the comparator is -- was relatively flattered, as you can say, by a particular treasury markets results in Q1 of last year
  -0.17  0 We're not quite done February, but it's a current measure
  -0.17  0 [indiscernible] I will come along and I will try and get everyone's questions in
   0.25  0 I've got one clarification, please
   0.00 -1 Just on the 5% to 7% CAGR you can see low incomes
  -0.50  0 And then a second one, which is on impairments
   0.00  1 The 2017 impairment, obviously, much better than last year
   0.00 -1 If we look at consensus, consensus is now lower for '18, '19 and '20
   0.00  1 And to Martin's point, we're not in the school that I think, that's just going to race ahead of market expectations
   0.00  1 And as such, we think that the market is -- in particular, our markets, will be well equipped to handle the effective shock that could come from higher interest rates
   0.00  1 It's just very well priced in
   0.00 -1 But one of the risk factors, for sure, is surprises in the risk -- in the Fed outlook
  -0.17  1 And impairments, yes, we absolutely think it's sustainable
  -0.17  0 So we're not saying that we'll never have a higher level of loan impairments
   0.00  1 But in terms of the credit cost that we've reported in 2017, certainly, is supportable and sustainable
   0.00 -1 And the -- by implication, if you look at the forward guidance, the 5 to 7 on top line below inflation are on the bottom line, this is going to be more about how do we get more for less over the 3, 4, 5-year period, yes? Clearly, the variable comp has impacted a little bit in '17 year, and it will depend a bit on how we perform in '18 relative to our expectations of how we'll do, as to where that could put a little bit more pressure on
   0.00  1  To be clear, say if you do deliver double-digit revenue wise, the chances are that the 2018 costs will also be a bit higher?  I'm saying that we have only had 2 months of the year of double-digit, and therefore, let's not get ahead of ourselves
  -1.00  0 2 questions, if I may
   0.00  1 The first one was, I was just looking at Slide 14 in the deck, on the balance sheet you mentioned, it was nice to see net interest margin expanding, and you're seeing customer loans up 12%, customer accounts up 9%
   0.00  1 Then if I think I've got an expanding margin and it looks like almost double-digit customer balance sheet growth
  -0.20  0 So that's not interest earning or maybe it is, but not overtly
   0.00 -1 So the retail bit, obviously, enduring
   0.11  0 The Corporate Finance, as we have discussed before, can move up and down a little bit depending on the timeliness of the deals and things like that
   0.09  0 And customer deposits, 1/3 FX, about 1/3 better retail deposits, and 1/3 the corporate OPAC accounts or credit accounts
  -0.50  0 I suppose is the question
   0.00 -1 But that is after a multi-year period when it has been down
   0.11  0  And just to add, I think we tried to position ourselves to be much more dynamic in terms of the way that we allocate our assets and liabilities
  -0.14  0 So it's not as bad a picture of margins staying constant for some period of time
  -0.25  0  And I have one follow-up question on capital as well
  -0.29  0 And when I look at, you had quite a big sort of 6% stress test drawdown
  -0.20  0 Stress drawdown may go up with IFRS 9 may have a lot of trough
  -0.20  0 And I think inherent in your question, there are still some moving parts in this
  -0.20  0 IFRS 9 has not yet been stress tested, and we'll see where that goes
  -0.11  0 Basel III, a, there is a level of national discretion, which isn't yet clear and the concept of stress testing of that is also completely new
  -0.12  0 And then thirdly, we've got preexisting for stress test and the future troughs in there
  -0.06  0 But our sense is we're in the right zone on that, but stress testing, things like that are clearly going to play a part as we evolve the thinking and the regulators evolve the thinking over the coming quarters
   0.20  0  And so you've got a [indiscernible]  Until we have a better number, it's 12% to 13%
   0.00 -1 Just firstly, on the regulatory cost, you were saying that you hoped that it was going to be peak and can we see it come down from here
   0.00 -1 I wondered how much you thought we might see a tail off from here, as some of those programs abate
   0.06  0 And then secondly, if I look at your average balance sheet disclosure, it looks like the noninterest-bearing liabilities, the noninterest-bearing deposits are actually remaining relatively stable or coming down
  -0.33  0 But it is a year when we had an abnormally high number of in [ flight ] purchased land
  -0.50  0 We are hanging around [indiscernible] with questions
   0.00 -1 So is there a much bigger pipeline that you'll release if you are more comfortable overall?  So the real constraint as we went from 2015 to '16 and '17 was capacity
   0.11  0 So as Andy pointed out in his slide, the investments that were not in just system replacement or regulatory improvements were $100 million in 2015, it's up to $800 million today
   0.00 -1 So we needed to ramp up pretty substantially our capacity to prudently and toughly make that incremental investment
  -0.50  0 We take those seriously
   0.09  0 So we have kept a pretty careful eye on the margin, as to whether we can be a bit more efficient in terms of how we invest and spend
   0.00  1 But you also saw in our ROE walk forward, we would expect expense increases to partially offset the income growth that we think we can generate
   0.17  0 So there is the things that we fully imagined, we would be investing in, as we've progressed with our business
  -0.11  0 So we have stepped up our pace of investment in that sort of area beyond what we've probably imagined in 2015 because the threats become more clear
   0.07  0 You've kind of helpfully given us some metrics on Slide 12, the progress you're showing, but I guess those are group averages, and you're in some pretty varied markets
   0.00 -1 We're just not
   0.00  1 We are still at a reasonably big technology and capability gap between where we are and where the best-of-class is in each market in which we operate
   0.00  1 But we've demonstrated an ability when we focused to get to best-in-class or at least to get to first to market, we'll subsequently demonstrate that we can be best-in-class
  -0.25  1 Africa has been a key and we really want to be at the cutting-edge across our African markets
   0.00  1 We want to get more than our share of growth from Africa
   0.00  1 We want to get more than our share of growth from South Asia
   0.20  0 We   want to demonstrate that we can satisfy a mass affluent market in India efficiently, and we haven't fully demonstrated that yet
   0.00  1 But the individual products and services that we're rolling out are laying a pretty good foundation for us to say, yes, when we focus on it, we can get it right
    nan  1 Good
  -1.00  1 Good questions, as always
   0.00  1 Appreciate your thoughtfulness and support
   0.25  0 And happy to engage as we ordinarily do in the days, weeks and months to come
   0.00  1 Thanks

   0.00  1                                             Good morning
   0.00  1 Thank you for joining us, and congratulations for actually making it here
  -0.17  0 So you're going to get really personal attention on your questions
  -0.06  0 We will try and take questions from sort of analysts particularly who dial in, which we don't normally, but given how hard people have sort of found it to get here and the fact we also have clashed with Travis Perkins as well for 1 or 2 analyst where we think is appropriate
  -0.50  0 So hopefully, one way or another with questions, and we'll go through it
  -0.11  0 So whilst we are not setting out forward guidance on dividends, you shouldn't read anything negative into that
   0.00  1 First of all, on the strategic landbank, that 17,000 additions is a -- it's just about a record
   0.00  1 I think we did almost the same number about 4 years ago, but it certainly runs well ahead of our long- term norm
  -0.11  1 And what you should read into this, and I will touch on this later, is actually we have seen an easing in the forward competition for strategic land
   0.00 -1 We've seen less competitions particularly from land promoters who have been a growing part of the market over the course of this cycle but definitely seem to have retrenched a little over the last year or so
   0.00 -1 The other 2 I will pick out are softer measures
  -0.05  1 So for the customer care year that just finished, we didn't quite get there, but the forward look for the customer care at the year, we're in the middle of it at the moment, is very good and that's after a lot of investment and a lot of focus from our teams
   0.11  0 But actually once we get beyond that, improving customer care is about looking at other measures, other metrics, looking at how   we actually recognize what customers really need rather than just dealing with maintenance and snagging issues better
   0.00  1 Clearly, a number that's above 0 is always uncomfortable, but an instant rate of 152 is an all-time record for us, and it's about half the industry average
  -0.14  0 It's something that in my entire 17 or 18 years in the business, the business that I have always taken sort of very, very seriously
   0.00  1 But I think our underlying performance is good
   0.00  1 And as I have said to you before, I think those customer care performances and that safety performance sort of is about a business that's running a very rounded way overall rather than just focused on short-term results
   0.00  1 Clearly, the first half of 2017 was a very strong performance, and in fact, particularly the first 10 weeks
  -0.20  0 And a large part of the reason it dropped off, we didn't have anything to sell
   0.00 -1 Yes, our order book peaked in that period at that point, which was uncomfortable
   0.00  1 And what you saw, as I touched on it in our trading update and I'll come back to sort of a couple of slides further on, is during 2017, our production caught up and we started to be able to get our sales rates and our build performance back in line
   0.00  1 We're very comfortable with where the order book is at the moment
   0.00  1 You can see that sort of overall the performance through sort of the back end of 2017 has remained strong
   0.00  1 But overall, we continue to see very strong levels of interest through all the channels that we sort of sell in
   0.00  1 We obviously saw base rates sort of move up and we see much clearer signaling about a potential for an increase in base rates over the next 12 months more quickly than we would have expected probably 6 months ago
   0.00 -1 In fact, the ordinary mortgage, the sort of 85% loan to value on new build, has actually come down over that time rather than increased
   0.00 -1 But you can also see that on the Help to Buy equity loan, the bottom end of the range has come down
   0.00  1 The others were 2 niche providers with slightly more expensive products, at the top end of the range, but still the level of sort of mortgage costs that people are getting when they take a 2- to 3-year fixed rate mortgage is at an all-time low and seems pretty resilient
   0.00 -1 It still remains very benign by any long-term standards
   0.00 -1 We made it in the short-term period of high risk to cover ourselves
   0.17 -1 So when we come on to May, I think there are things that we can do that previously we would have not expected to be able to achieve
   0.00 -1 In London specifically, we see the land environment less highly competitive than we have seen historically
   0.25  0 But if the right deals come up, we'd still happily do them
   0.08  0 The timing and exactly the deals that you do at a different point should be dependent on the quality of what's available, but we expect to be in Central London to stay
   0.00 -1 And as I touched on with strategic land, we have seen reduced competition
   0.00  1 That was significantly higher than anything we've done historically
  -0.08  0 And if you look ahead, we're not setting a new target per se, but that 9,000 probably isn't a bad indication of where it might average over time
   0.00  1 It does bring its challenges, but it brings some huge benefits
   0.00  1 The yellow dot is the 2017 average, and that's where you can see both on margin and on return on capital is running ahead of the sort of guidance that we've given in terms of new acquisitions
   0.00  1 And as I've said before, don't expect the 2017 dot to be a totally new normal but actually more strongly than before, I think it is close to that, sort of we're not getting big pushback and finding it really hard to find sites at that level
  -0.11  1 Beginning last year, we found it a little bit more difficult, but then it eased off, and actually, we've been able to deliver those sorts of returns, which we then beat when it comes through the P&L account and pretty consistently now through sort of 18 months post Brexit
  -0.07  0 And I think as ever we find, as we have early conversations on -- sort of with Oliver Letwin, the -- when you lay out the facts, people do start to quickly understand the issue wasn't quite what they thought it was from a distance
   0.00 -1 Moving on to a couple of areas that I would just like to pick out on some of the softer measures in the business
   0.11  0 I'm not going to go through everything on this slide, but it just sets out and we've grouped them into 3 boxes of culture, attracting people in development, and paying benefits, some of the areas that we've been working on over the last couple of years and some of the things that we've done
   0.00  1 I think the key message is it has made a huge difference
   0.00 -1 Our sort of staff turnover has been structurally lower than we think our competitors and where we were at any equivalent point in previous cycles
   0.00  1 So we have made sure that our underlying pay is in the right place, but I wouldn't say it's massively ahead of the competitors
  -0.09  0 But what we have done is change fundamentally things around flexible working, how we deal with helping our employees to buy a Taylor Wimpey house, how we engage with people, how we deal with diversity issues and all of those
   0.00 -1 We don't see that
   0.00  1 The level of consistency and financial performance comes from the level of consistency in the people teams that we have
   0.00 -1 We dipped more than we were comfortable with in 2015 and '16
  -0.06  1 And you go back to those big sites and actually really understanding how to appeal to customers beyond the traditional sales model is one of the keys to the potential to drive out more volume and more value where we have large land holdings, and absorption can be the limiting factor
   0.00 -1 And you can see the extent to which we brought those completions forward, so there's less pressure on our build teams
   0.00  1 And that's made a big difference to not just the delivery of customer service but making sure we're in control of costs
   0.00  1 Again, you can see we're consistently further ahead on build status
   0.00  1  Thanks, Pete, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen
   0.00  1 And as a result, an underlying operating margin of 21.2% is up 0.4 percentage points on 2016
   0.20  0 Spain delivers GBP 26.8 million with operating profit in the period
   0.00  1 And the high-quality landbank that currently stands at 2,675 plots is up 25% from 2016
   0.11  0 And there are a few more operational statistics and information on the Spanish business in the appendices that we normally would include
   0.00  1 Interest costs for the group are slightly lower year-on- year and due mainly to lower debt finance costs following the repayment of the corporate loan that we had in the second half of 2016 as well as lower average borrowings for the period
   0.00  1 This has been partially offset by slightly higher land creditor discount unwind in the period as a result of average higher land creditors year-on-year
  -0.07  1   Tangible net asset value per share of 95.7p is up 8% year-on-year, reflecting the continued investment in the business as well as the lower pension deficit and is after paying 13.8p in dividends
  -0.10  0 We have a large joint venture site in Bordon in Hampshire, quite major developments, and 3 large joint ventures in London, which will all be contributing to volumes for many more years to come
   0.20  0 Total underlying profit in the U.K
   0.00  1 business at GBP 814 million is up 9.5 percentage points on 2016
   0.00  1 We think that the net impact of the market- led sales prices and their locations that we sell from and offset by the build cost inflation that we're seeing in the wider market added 0.7 percentage points to margins with ASPs continuing to rise at a pace that is marginally ahead of build cost inflation
   0.00 -1 The net change in land mix year-on-year has reduced margins by 0.3% due to mix and trading pattern
   0.00 -1 And with the higher investment in customer services than some of the other processes that we've implemented in '17, including the build quality, has reduced margins by approximately 0.3 percentage points year-on-year
   0.14  0 The way that we account for joint ventures and the share of net profits have added 0.2% to the margins in the year
   0.00 -1 And at the time, we indicated that this was one of the toughest of the targets that we set
   0.13 -1 Build cost recovery continues to trend towards upwards given the greater burden of infrastructure on the larger strategic sites and effect of build cost inflation and higher spend on improvement in product quality offsetting the lower land recovery
  -0.20  0 But there can be certain minimal elements of volatility in that, but broadly about the same
   0.00  1 And contribution   per completion has increased to just over GBP 69,000, which is up 5.8% on the year and up by 17% since 2015
   0.12  0 This is very much dependent at the pace which customers make application to change their leases to be one that is RPI based rather than 10-year doubling
   0.08  0 The dynamic of ever so marginal cash release from net land investment, including changes in land creditors, continues despite the overall scale of the landbank staying broadly the same
   0.12  0 There's been a slight increase in overall investments in work in progress year-on-year, reflecting the slight increase in infrastructure cost combined with build cost inflation and a greater level of work in progress that's on the balance sheet for the additional time required improving the quality of home delivery that Pete spoke about earlier
   0.00  1 Net asset growth after returning GBP 450 million to shareholders in the year is up 8.2%, reflecting the strong profitability, as well as pension deficit movements offset by the leasehold provision
   0.00  1 landbank, total potential revenue in the landbank has increased by GBP 5 billion year-on- year to GBP 47 billion
   0.00  1 This is driven by an increase in average selling price as well as the overall scale of our strategic land pipeline, where we continue to actively pursue permissions -- planning permissions
   0.00  1 Land cost of plots relative to the expected revenues in the short term, owned landbank is down by 0.6 percentage points to 14.8%, reflecting the continued quality of investment margins as well as growth in the wider housing market
  -0.05  1 The margins delivered in the year on sites that we acquired since 2009, when we reentered the land market following the financial crisis, were 1.7 percentage points on average higher than the investment assumptions that we've been -- that we've made at that point
   0.00  1 The pensions deficit is materially lower on 2016, driven principally by the asset performance following the investment strategy and also helped by the hedging program that we've got against the liabilities and improvements in actuarial assumptions, particularly on mortality
  -0.07  0 However, given the ongoing commitments we've got for funding the scheme results in an IFRIC 14 adjustment of GBP 88 million, resulting in a deficit for accounting purposes of GBP 64 million
   0.00  1 This, combined with updates in mortality tables year-on-year, has resulted in a significant reduction in the liabilities
  -0.20  0 The triennial valuation for 2016 has been concluded with the trustee, and that resulted in a deficit of -- a technical provisions deficit of GBP 222 million
  -0.08  0 If you had to roll that forward from 2016 to 2017 on a consistent basis, the deficit is reduced to only GBP 30 million using exactly the same actuarial basis   for the calculation
  -0.12  0 The recovery payments will, however, be suspended to the extent that the scheme becomes fully funded on a technical provisions basis and will only recommence payment if the scheme drops below a 96% funding level
  -0.25  0 The first test will be the 31st of March 2018 and subject to market movements
   0.00 -1 The expectation over the next 3 years will be that we will probably contribute marginally less cash into the scheme given how well capitalized it is
   0.10  0 However, there's been greater levels of infrastructure investment on particularly those larger strategic sites, as we noted before
   0.06 -1 The profit and loss work in progress recovery has continued to get closer and closer to the cash investment levels as both the shift to large strategic sites has been completed, with a related high infrastructure burden
   0.00  1 Land cost per plot recovered to the P&L has shown marginal growth over the past 5 years
   0.00 -1 And with the current cost per plot in the balance sheet, I expect this level of net land investment to only marginally grow as the land is replaced
   0.00  1 With the balance sheet broadly at what we believe is optimal scale and a higher proportion of quality earnings generated are being converted into cash and that's available for distribution to shareholders, the strong cash generation trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future underpinned by the high quality landbank and lower level of adjusted gearing
  -0.08  0 This combined with the GBP 340 million special dividend declared in July of last year for payment this year means that we will return GBP 500 million to shareholders in 2018, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in April
   0.00  1 Overall, the balance sheet remains strong, with adjusted gearing, including land creditors, of only 4% gearing relative to the 8% in the previous year
   0.00  1 The declaration of the special dividend means that we have met the GBP 1.3 billion cash target that we set ourselves over the 3 years
   0.00  1 The net asset growth year-on-year before dividends returned to shareholders of 23.7% reflects strong total equity returns
   0.00  1 And as noted before, the return on net operating assets continues to run above the target we set ourselves
   0.11  0 So 3 slides on how trading has been over the course of the last few weeks and then 2 on our thoughts in advance of our Capital Markets Day in May
   0.00 -1 During the course of both 2016, when obviously the first half was strong but not as strong as last year, and 2017, the second half sales rates were compressed because of our availability of product and things to sell
   0.00 -1 You go back to if we're selling 6 months ahead, get much ahead of that, and we get pretty uncomfortable
  -0.17  0 And as you can see, cancellation rates still in line with sort of what we've expected
   0.20 -1 Our exposure in terms of guidance on profitability is short
   0.00  1 And we still have very much the perspective that Central London is a good place to be long term
  -0.11  0 And actually, if we get too much into a short-term reactivity to a market, then we make the wrong long-term decision
   0.07  0 So you wouldn't necessarily expect to see us push large amounts of capital in Central London over the course of the next 6 to 12 months, but if there are great opportunities, then we won't be averse to taking them
   0.12  0 So it's very much opportunity led at the moment, but we're certainly not expecting to pull out
   0.17  0 And we see that profit contribution from sites who already have started to build up again, as I say, back in the 2019 but particularly 2020, 2021
   0.06 -1 The first point on here is one that everybody knows, and almost through the last cycle, we became uncomfortable talking about, but actually, as we've gone through this cycle, you can see it clearly impacting on the stability in our market
   0.00  1 The supply-demand imbalance remains, and that means that our confidence in our long-term prospects remains very strong
   0.00 -1 We've probably been the most cautious in always saying that we remain in a cyclical business
   0.00 -1 The flip side to that is in the short to medium term, we should be cautious and concerned about customers' ability to finance a house to purchase without dependence on Help to Buy
  -0.29  0 We're not worried about what's going to happen in late '20, sort of '19 -- or sorry, 2018 and 2020
   0.08 -1 But I think we have a tendency as a sector to say, yes, planning is a bit better at the moment, but it's still terrible, and nothing has really changed
   0.00 -1 And I think the combination of the competition for land and that planning environment has a significant impact on the business
   0.00  1 But I think people underestimate the extent to which it's impacted on the financial structure of the business, the amount of capital we have to lock up to keep the size of landbank we have is less, but it also means our ability to potentially shorten that landbank is greater
   0.00 -1 And you see across the sector, those that have struggled with, the obvious example being Bovis at the extreme end
   0.00  1 I think there's also value creation if you get it right
   0.00  1 So the engine room has a value
   0.00 -1 There is a political and economic need for more housing, but we genuinely can't deliver it
   0.00 -1 I think the risk of not being a business that operates in a responsible way and not having an understanding of those drivers is significant
   0.00  1 We've always believed it the right thing to do
  -0.25  0 The ones -- not everything on this chart will change from where we are now, but we are seriously looking at all of them, and some of them will change
  -0.25  0 I don't think it works quite that way
   0.25  0 And I think we can probably give you better information than just the simple sales, right, and outlet numbers
   0.33  0 You should understand the relationship between the 2 better
   0.00  1 We still see -- we're a cyclical business, and having a strong balance sheet is key
   0.00  1 And we still see that having a significant dividend is a key element of the value proposition to shareholders
   0.00 -1 Some of the things we've touched on already around resourcing direct labor, actually how we get our build strategy right over a longer period of time and pieces on social purpose in that community and political risks
   0.20  0 And I repeat what I said at the beginning: Please do not read anything into that the 2019 dividends are going to go down from 2018
  -0.50  0 Open up for questions
  -0.17  0 And you could -- on this occasion, you're allowed 6 or 7 questions, if you want
  -0.17  0 Though, although, I don't know if we got question on the line, not yet, so
   0.00  1 Your 2 larger peers, we've seen make quite a lot -- a big push, if you like, on build cost efficiencies
  -0.09  0 The other one, for whom that lies ahead, and it didn't -- it wasn't really a part of the priorities you highlighted there for the [ CMD ]
   0.17  0 Does that play out this year or does it continue, you think, in '19 and '20 in terms of that improvement?  Thanks
  -0.25  0 I'm not sure I understood the second question
   0.00  1  And we still see overall a higher margin on strategic land
   0.00  1 The gap has narrowed simply because land costs are lower so strategic land percentage sort of saving is lower
   0.17  0 But no, we have -- definitely haven't seen the position where strategic land is -- it was a lower margin
   0.25  0 I mean, it will massively depend on the exact mix of sites
   0.00 -1 And if we sort of have a mix of smaller sites particularly, sort of that would tend to push it down slightly
  -0.33  0 It's not distorted by any one measure
   0.00 -1 We certainly don't see that going backwards
   0.14  0 On build cost   efficiencies, I think we -- there's still more we have to do, definitely
   0.00  1 What we are not setting ourselves up to be is the lowest-cost producer
   0.00 -1 It's not where we want to be, and it's not where we see the long-term sort of value
  -0.11  1 Being the lowest-cost producer is always going to result in quite a high-risk strategy, particularly when the market changes
  -0.10  0 Sort of I think, if we're looking again at the moment at a house site range and quite significantly reducing it, these things tend to grow up over time
  -0.17  0 That becomes quite a chunky number on its own right on the balance sheet
  -0.17  0 I think we'll sort of work through that while we have a serious think about Spain
   0.10  0 Its values is better, and you have started to see, as you will have seen, sort of a number of deals happened sort of private to public sort of deals
   1.00  0 Just 3 if I could as well, please
   0.08  0 The first one's just on your working cap swing through the year, net cash position on average, just to get a sense to where the cash is moving over the next few years
   0.50  0 A reminder there, please
   0.00 -1 Obviously, you've seen how that kind of land percentages of the ASP has shrunk over the years
   0.06  0 And as you saw from Pete's chart earlier in terms of number of completions in the last 2 months of the year, we are still back- end weighted, and so there's a bit of working capital that goes in, but it doesn't change us into a net debt position
  -0.20  0  And I'm not quite sure how to give you a mathematical answer to question on the average site size
   0.00  1 It has grown, and it's continued to grow
   0.00 -1 I certainly don't think it's going to reverse
   0.00  1 And one of those is broadening our reach to market
   0.07 -1 I think the way we've looked at it, we would be happy to own for a period of time, but I think we're unlikely to decide it makes sense for us to be the long-term owner of a large portfolio
   0.00 -1 Just isn't strategic enough and doesn't give us the sort of levers into the market that we might want
   0.00  1 So, yes, I think it will, but I don't necessarily think that's an overnight thing, so it will build up steadily over time
  -0.14  0 You feel like you got to ask a question, I mean, there's only a few people ahead
   0.00 -1 You obviously had a little bit of a headwind from some of customer care cost you put in
   0.00 -1 We'll definitely allow it, but I'm sure it's -- so the political landscape is -- sort of has risks in it
  -0.10  0 I think that the sort of the big scary things that you worry about, sort of don't feel like they're sort of really in serious consideration, you mentioned windfall tax, the things you can do nothing about because they're kind of slightly arbitrary
  -0.14  0 I think the conversations we are having at the moment are pretty rational, sensible ones about what the constraints really are
   0.00 -1 But you know we're in a sort of politically uncertain -- well, not just in our sector but across the piece
   0.12  0 And the risks are a bit greater in that environment, so you can't totally rule them out, ultra low but not zero
  -0.14  0 My -- they're definitely looking at it, I would say, slightly more critically than was the case previously
  -0.12  0 I still think that's the right answer, so I wouldn't be sort of arguing against that
   0.00 -1 I don't think it's very likely that suddenly they'll click their fingers remove it because the risk sort of too biased, the housing market to the overall economy is too great, so it would be a pretty irrational, self-destructive thing to do
   0.12 -1 And I think the risk of it being wound out over to the time that we should adapt to and management should see as sort of a positive
   0.11  0 We shouldn't want to be dependent on that level of government plan subsidy
   0.00 -1 It hasn't really changed, so I think it is sort of very unlikely that we get to over the 3-year average ending in 2018
  -0.12  0 But actually, you just need -- we don't need everything to fire on all cylinders to get there
   0.17  0 So I certainly think it's a perfectly reasonable target
   0.00  1 But I certainly still think there's a bit of potential upside to come
  -0.08  0 I don't think we'll likely to think about it just with the kind of the short-term kind of share price volatility we've seen over the course of the last few weeks and today
   0.00  1 But if we saw that kind of piece, where actually we thought, no, business is well capitalized, it is very strong, actually there's a lot of opportunities in that kind of environment, but the market was very cautious about housebuilders, then I think we'd seriously consider it
  -0.06  0 And as I've said before, I think where we'd seriously consider it will be incremental to a dividend we'd announce generally rather than just switching it into a dividend payment, but they'd have to be structurally different in terms of price
   0.25  0 The answer is it's the sense of achievement
   0.00  1  Thank you

   0.00  1 Nice to see you all
   0.20  0 So we thought what we do this morning, as well as sharing with you the results, is share with you a little bit of a perspective of where we think we are for the 3 years in before we commence the opportunity -- the big opportunity, which is Booker
  -0.02  0 So when we do get to the Q&A at the end, with the usual rules of one question, not model-driven, strategic, insightful, entertaining questions, if either myself or Alan can't answer those, then I'll call upon members of the exec who are here to add a little color, flavor and depth, if that's helpful to you, okay? So what we're going to do, talk about the results, and I'll pass to Alan immediately to do that, and then I'll come back and give you a perspective on the 3 years through 2 lenses, really, the 6 drivers that we shared a number of years ago but also from that stakeholder point of view that we've shared previously as well
   0.00  1 Good morning, everybody
   0.14  0 As Dave said, it's been a year of progress, and I'll begin with the group results
   0.00  1 And importantly, we've had another strong year of retail cash generation, up 21.7% to GBP 2.8 billion
   0.00  1 As you know, we've played -- placed significant emphasis on fresh food as the driver of our recovery over the past few years
   0.00 -1 As expected, we've continued to see a drag from our efforts to de-emphasize certain parts of our general merchandise business in order to shift the focus to more profitable lines, with GM volumes down 7.2%
   0.00 -1 We further refined our range, reducing the number of SKUs by 16% and reducing sales in certain categories
   0.00 -1 An example would be electronics, where it's down more than 10%
   0.10  0 We're still focused on driving growth and profitable sustainable categories of general merchandise
   0.00  1 Overall, we've seen 260,000 more customers shopping with us year-on-year, with the average basket spend up 2.5%
   0.00  1 & Ireland segment up 50 basis points year-on-year
   0.00  1 We've seen strong like-for-like sales growth of 2.3% for the year, maintaining similar levels throughout every quarter
   0.00  1 The fresh food category is strong
   0.00  1 This is driven by a particularly strong performance in meat, fish and poultry
   0.00  1 We've continued to see strong customer take-up of our own brand products, helped by the ongoing relaunch, which started last November
   0.00  1 Own brand now accounts for 51% of total sales, up nearly 1 percentage point year-on-year
   0.00  1 As usual, we've included details in terms of like-for-like sales and channel analysis in your packs, from which you'll see that we've had a particularly strong performance in our large stores
   0.00  1 Superstore like-for- like sales were up 2.6%, and extras were up 1.8%
   0.00  1 We saw 5% -- slightly over 5% growth in Grocery Home Shopping, once again, driven by increases in both order numbers and in basket size
   0.00  1 As you can see from the waterfall on the right of this chart, operating margin has increased by 50 basis points to 2.3%
   0.00  1 Our cost-saving plan delivered a reduction in costs in the U.K
   0.00  1 of GBP 404 million during the year, more than offsetting the cost inflation we've seen
   0.10  0 & Ireland operating profit before exceptional items includes transaction costs and fees of GBP 21 million arising from our merger with the Booker Group
   0.12  0 This is consistent with the treatment in the prior year, where we had GBP 26 million of costs also included in the operating profit before exceptional items
   0.00  1 We've delivered like-for-like sales growth in food of plus 1.2%, with fresh food again being a key focus
  -0.08  1 This strong performance continues to be offset by the drag from general merchandise as we refocus our offer, similar to what we're doing in the U.K
   0.00  1 The Czech Republic and Slovakia continued to deliver strong like-for-like growth
   0.00 -1 As we've mentioned throughout the year, the headline sales numbers are significantly impacted by the strategic decision taken in Thailand to remove unprofitable bulk selling and mass couponing activities in order to focus on sustainable, profitable sales growth
   0.00 -1 When stripping out this impact, Asia's like-for-like sales were down around 1%, largely reflecting our investment in price across the region
   0.00  1 We continue to build the mortgage base, with total mortgage lending up 39%
   0.00  1 Secured lending now accounts for 26% of the loan book, up 440 basis points year-on-year
   0.00  1 Tesco Bank recently won the Best Direct Lender Award for the third year running as, again, a focus of our commitment to customer and value for our customers
   0.00  1 The balance sheet remains strong with a risk asset ratio of 19.3%
   0.11  0 As you may be aware, IFRS 9 financial instruments has come into effect for all accounting periods beginning after 1st January 2018
   0.00 -1 As a result, the opening retained earnings for Tesco Bank for the '18, '19 financial year are expected to be reduced by GBP 166 million
  -0.07  0 Shouldn't make any impact on the long -- on the overall results of the business, but the timing of recognition of losses changes as a result of this standard
   0.06  0 I'd like again to draw your attention to the differing rates of growth between the secured and the unsecured lending, reflecting the bank's greater focus on secured lending
   0.00  1 The improvement in our cost-to-income ratio to 59.7% follows the restructuring changes we made in the bank last year
   0.08  0 I should note that this includes GBP 102 million timing benefit driven by trade payables arriving from the -- arising from the Palmer & Harvey administration towards the end of the financial year
   0.00  1 Our exceptional cash items results in an outflow of GBP 192 million
  -0.17  0 These are made up of GBP 149 million of payments in relation to the deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO and the shareholder compensation scheme payments
  -0.29  0 There are GBP 122 million of restructuring costs and GBP 92 million of onerous lease utilizations
   0.10  0 These are offset by GBP 160 million recovered from HMRC regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard benefits
   0.12  0 HMRC has appealed this decision, so there is the possibility of a cash outflow in the future should their appeal be successful
   0.00 -1 Net interest and tax payments of GBP 428 million were GBP 113 million lower than last year, largely as a result of a maturing debt and the 2 liability management exercises we undertook during the year
  -0.05  0   We raised GBP 362 million through disposals and dividends received, primarily driven by the sale of our remaining minority stake in Lazada online business and our opticians business division Express as well as the GBP 50 million dividend we'll receive from Tesco Bank
  -0.17  0 We also covered the significant reduction in pension deficit as calculated by IAS 19
   0.10  0 This slide on debt reduction gives some more color on our progress on gross debt within the year
   0.00  1 As you can see from this slide, we've targeted bonds with high coupon rates to maximize the return
   0.12  0 The exception to this was our Eurobond maturing in 2019, which we repurchased to help smooth our debt maturity profile
  -0.12  0 Our intention remains to return to an investment-grade credit rating, with our key threshold metrics being fixed charge cover in excess of 3x and total indebtedness of less than 3x EBITDA (sic) [ EBITDAR ]
   0.12  0 We expect this will utilize around GBP 150 million of cash per annum, with the exact amount dependent on our performance each year
   0.12  0 Before I conclude, I have a slide summarizing our guidance for the key financial metrics and how we see our continued progression
   0.09  0 I've also included here our debt metrics for total indebtedness less than 3x EBITDA (sic) [ EBITDAR ] and the fixed charge cover of greater than 3x
   0.00  1 We've also made substantial progress across the group on our cost-saving target -- program, with total cost savings of GBP 594 million in the year and GBP 820 million of savings to date, well in excess of half of the target we've set ourselves
   0.08  0 We do that obviously to give you sights of the progress that we're making but also recognizing, as Alan says, going forward, we'll obviously incorporate Booker
   0.00  1 If you look at the metrics on the right-hand side, the 3 that I picked out, again, are the ones consistent with how we've reviewed them over the period: net Promoter Score, up 15 points; the quality perception of the brand has doubled over that time period; and the value perception of the brand has tripled over that period
   0.00  1 As Alan says, we're well on our way in terms of the operating costs, so GBP 820 million so far, the trajectory ahead of that we shared when we shared the guidance a couple of years ago
   0.10  0 And on the right- hand side, I've given you a little update in terms of the progress that we're making in the buckets that we shared at that time
   0.17  0 On the right-hand side, we were trying to give you a little more insight in terms of cash
   0.33  0 It's so easy to say than   it is to do
   0.07  0 The bit that I'll update is the bottom right-hand corner at this point, which is we -- second half of '14, '15, the margin for the group was 0.8%; full year was 1.8%; and you've seen stable first year, 2.3%, 2.9%; exit the year just above 3%
   0.00 -1 & Ireland was negative in terms of its profitability and is at 2.5% in the second half of this year
  -0.11  0 And I suppose that's the thing that I think, when we talk about managing the mix, being prepared to walk away from unprofitable sales
   0.00  1 Once we've first taken out the costs of delivering those unprofitable sales is something we've been prepared to do in order to enhance the quality and the sustainability of the business model
  -0.10  0 And Asia probably is the biggest single example of that, whilst we've been doing quite a lot of it in the U.K
  -0.07  0 What I've done here is break down, back to the U.K., what's driving our growth versus what's driving growth in our competitive set
  -0.17  0 market across the competitive set is actually quite different
  -0.08  1 You -- the things that you will have seen over 3 years, freehold proportion has gone above 50%, so we've been quite active in buying back property that we felt were part of the sustainable future of the business
  -0.06  0 Look, I suppose the one, if I think back over 3 years, that whilst there's an awful lot, there's one that stands out as being quite a pivotal moment for us, the decision to invest in the farm brands with a big deal
   0.09  0 So if you look at the top there, the picture of the farm brands, just give you a little insight, in the 12 months that we're just reporting, sales of the farm brands in the U.K
   0.11  0 But there's been a lot of innovation, and dare I say there's an awful lot more to come
   0.10  0 So far, we've launched 5 more exclusive brands that replaced the value tier, and you would've seen some of those in the foyer as we go
   0.00  1 Clubcard relaunched in the year to be contactless, it gives us a lot more capability going forward
   0.00  1 It's reinvigorated engagement with Clubcard
   0.20  0 There's been some work around partnerships and how we use it for reward
   0.12  0 So just some examples of what's current, if you like, in terms of that 3-year trend on innovation
   0.00  1 And if I come all the way forward to February of '18, actually, we're gaining market share again
   0.33 -1 business, which was to regain competitiveness
   0.10  0 If I talk about colleagues, look, there's been an awful lot of change for Tesco colleagues over the 3 years, not all of it easy by any stretch
  -0.25  0 And anybody in retail knows that your colleagues are by far and away your harshest critics
   0.00  1 They're also your most knowledgeable customers
   0.00  1 Listening to colleagues is really, really helpful in terms of the things we have to do
   0.08  0 Try to give you an insight into transformation, what's really happened, because I'm very conscious that when we make a change, everybody talks about that one particular change
  -0.04  1 But between August of '14 and now, with all of the changes that we've done, we have more than 18,000 more customer-facing roles, right, as we've made lots and lots of changes around what we've been doing, if you remember in those early presentations, how did we increase the amount of Tesco talent and resource which is serving customers, we have increased the percentage of our people who are serving customers really quite significantly
  -0.20  0 It's been really quite a dramatic shift
  -0.17  1 and what we did in our head offices around,   it's really quite a radical transformation
   0.00  1 I have nothing but admiration for what Jason and the team have done in rebooting, if you like, the relationship that we have with our suppliers
   0.17  0 The supplier viewpoint in terms of satisfaction 3 years on has moved from 51% to 78%
   0.11  0 And externally, you see that, that change in the way that we approach has come through in the Advantage survey, where we were definitely middle of the pack in '14, '15 but have been first, as voted by our suppliers for the last 2 years
   0.00  1 And it -- obviously, we talked about a volume-led recovery
  -0.22  1 Arresting that decline, getting ourselves back to competitive levels of growth is something that our suppliers clearly appreciate
  -0.20  0 So quite a fundamental change in the way that our relationships with suppliers has seen
   0.00  1 And I suppose, finally, obviously very importantly, our shareholders
   0.00  1 We're now gaining share in food full year U.K
   0.00  1 The margin -- group margin is now exiting the year just above 3%
   0.00  1 The capital discipline
   0.00  1 The last 3 years, we've been very, very, very tight with capital, changed the metrics that we use, changed the payback periods that we look for and actually been very tight in the way that we look at capital across
  -0.20  1 I'm quite happy for that challenge to come in
   0.08  0 But I suppose from a Tesco perspective, getting that percentage under 2 years hopefully gives you an insight into the discipline and the respect that we have for capital investment in the business
  -0.17  0 And what comes next, I suspect, is dominated by what it is we've done in the merger of coming together with Booker
   0.12  0 We know we're really clear that there are some opportunities in the complementary nature of the 2 ranges across the 2 businesses
   1.00  0 So a little insight into what does that mean
   0.08  0 Now it was easier for us to make Booker a customer of Tesco, so we actually started in a couple of stores, right, right out of the bat, having 30 of those lines in a few of our stores
  -0.12  0 That range, as Jason was telling me only yesterday, justifies itself from a sales density point of view already, and there's very little, if any, communication about that
   0.11  0 I have to say partly from customer and market opportunity but partly on a very practical basis
  -0.33  0 For those who have ever been to Bar Hill, don't know how many have, we used to have a Dobbies in Bar Hill
  -0.07  0 So as part of Joining Forces, on a tenancy basis, we started to prepare for Booker to become a tenant inside a Tesco store in order for us to test this proposition
   0.00  1 It's a professional offer that doesn't exist in that neighborhood, and you can see the sales begin to grow
   0.00  1 It's also an offer that Tesco shoppers can avail themselves to if they want to come out of our Extra store and go into the Chef Central proposition, okay? Now really very interesting for us
   0.14  0 So we can talk about it live and with reality in terms of what it is we're thinking about the opportunity going forward
  -0.12  0 And that would allow us to utilize those delivery vehicles at the time of day that they currently stand idle
   0.00  1 We're -- I think we're pretty fast out of the gate in terms of the range and Chef Central and the relationships with suppliers, but it's the start of what we think is really quite a big opportunity
   0.25  0 This is where those growth opportunities start to move us towards
   0.14  0 And we have an aspiration of growth which is GBP 2.5 billion, and if there's more to go for, you can be rest assured we'll go for it
  -0.09  1 When you look at the intent, it's amazing, amazing how actually aligned they are in terms of priorities values and wishes
   0.14  0 So what we chose to do for our own employees is share and I've simplified for you here, if you think about the combined business, the idea of serving Britain customers a little better every day fits perfectly
   0.15  0 If anybody who's visited Charles, he's a Booker investor over the last 10 years, he would have told you about health safe and legal, customer satisfaction, customer profitability, same thing
   0.12  0 So serving Britain's customers little better every day is the magnetic north of the combined organization
   0.50 -1   Customer satisfaction is there for both
   1.00  0 Cash profitability is there for both and has been throughout
   0.00  1 This idea, we're really very clear
   0.08  0 People always ask me about integration, it's 1 team, it's exactly how we've been running the others parts of Tesco, which is built with very special channel expertise
   0.33  0 Booker is a brilliant wholesaling business
  -0.33  0 And likewise, Tesco is not a bad retailer either
   0.17  0 Speed, we're not spending a lot of time integrating businesses
   0.00  1 So for those who are not familiar, we bring back and putt in to the operating principles of Cohen edict, which means if you are not familiar, the letters mean you can't do business sitting on your a**, right, which seem like a very good way of encapsulating the need for speed
   0.06  0 I think if you ask us what our underlying philosophy is, and again we've touched on this a couple of times, but it's also manifested in the Booker business, is an absolute focus on cash profitability
   0.20  0 All the things that set a quantum cash profitability, we'll carry on doing that
   0.00  1 It's very consistent with how Booker works and that's what we will do going forward
   0.33  0 So our underlying philosophy is cash profitability
   0.00  1 We're delivering against the 6 drivers
   0.00 -1 Thankfully, debt is down
  -0.33  0 And now we'll open it up to questions
  -0.17  0 And so if there are any detailed banking questions, I'll be calling on Iain to help
  -0.33  0 So we'll move to questions
  -1.00  0 Just one question for me
   0.00  1 But the other thing that your question allows me to talk about, as I said at the end, as we talked about a recovery which was led by volume then augmented by mix, cost effectiveness and then new growth
   0.00  1 We've put in growth over the 3 years we have
   0.14  0 And then we need to outperform the macro environment and volume is the way our suppliers understand it
   0.11  0 And so I think, Rob, the distinction here is between what you can put in perspectives and you have to be able to demonstrate and prove versus actually what is an aspiration for us as there
   0.25  0 The opportunity on top of revenue growth is depending which of those initiatives work will depend on the margin profile
   0.04  0 Could you give some indication of how you see the group balance sheet being this time next year after the equity issue, maybe a comment on working capital, free cash from Booker so we get a better feel just at this stage rather than throwing darts in the dark as usual as to how the group's going to look?  Yes
   0.00  1 In terms of the Booker impact, the GBP 120 million which comes onto our balance sheet at the time that of the merger is a number which is after paying away the dividend, the final dividend for Booker, so it's really augmenting our cash
  -0.04  1 But critically, the focus on capital discipline, free cash generation, paying a dividend which over time is twice covered, we are just under 4x covered today, so there's a lot of growth potential within that dividend putting aside earnings growth, which equally gives us the potential to increase the dividend
   0.00  1 And we then end up I think with a balance sheet which is a strong balance sheet, sustainable with the business which is generating very strong cash
   0.07  0 The GBP 195 million of cash which Booker generated, which isn't again an underlying number, is something which as we've seen from Booker's track record, operating profit translates pretty closely into cash from a Booker perspective
   0.00  1 Put that with the tax interest reduction from liability management exercises we've done, and we have a very strong cash generation in our business
   0.00 -1 Don't know if that helps, Clive
  -1.00  0 One question for Charles if I can
  -0.17  0 I don't know if he's answering questions or maybe if you could do that, Dave
  -0.12  0 retail?  Definitely can answer that one, Charles?  James, I'll answer a question that I got asked during coffee
   0.00  1 What was the pleasant surprise, okay, me joining Tesco because I might be here about 5.5 weeks, is actually the people
   0.00  1 When you're in stores, we've got some very, very strong store operators
   0.00  1 And Jason and I have had the privilege of working together with some of the buying teams and the Booker buying teams and the Tesco buying teams getting on very well in Bar Hill because we're winning together
   0.00  1 And then we're starting to say how we've build on that good work to deliver what Dave and Alan had been articulating
   0.00  1 You showed a chart showing how you deliver cost savings ahead of your original dotted line plan
   0.14 -1 I think, in other parts, there are some of the opportunities we saw actually were harder to get to them, always the nature of these things, is never lands the way that you do
   0.00  1 And that was paid for through a number of ways, not least of which a significant part of it was volume leverage and the cost savings
   0.00  1 It's nice to be ahead of the one that we plotted because, clearly, there was some thought behind the plot that we gave -- did
   0.00  1 And what would the business look like financially and as a shape if you're able to get your brand index ahead of your peers?  It is a great question
   0.04  0 You would have seen on the way in, right? So if you didn't look at the own-label relaunch activity, would have also seen the naked kitchen activity, completely exclusive, unique to Tesco, bringing 44% new people into the category, something they can't get anywhere else, absolutely bang on trend
   0.14  0 That is something exclusive that's relevant to Tesco that actually customers value
   0.20  0 And ultimately a marketing theory that plays into price positioning
   0.50  0 and ROI profit
   0.00  1 If I look at what you are printing today versus what you printed in the first half, we saw significant reversal of these prices, it was a negative impact in H1, it's a positive for the full year
   0.10  0 I know the scale is different, but can you elaborate on the trends in H2 versus H1 or the significant changes that the charts are highlighting?  So I think that the biggest driver, clearly, which we have highlighted, is our price positioning in H1 relative to price positioning in H2
   0.00  1 And in H1, we took a very active decision in terms of the, as inflation came through into the market, a number of us -- of participants had hedged to a certain degree, that hedge began to unwind, and we saw inflation coming into the market and it was pretty strong, we held back, we worked with our suppliers to try to absorb that for as long as possible
   0.00 -1 But clearly, there was some cost to us in terms of the business
   0.12  0 As we then moved to the second half of the year, the price positioning and the inflation, we didn't hold back on as much
   0.00  1 So to the point of second half, first half, we definitely had, we were more aligned with the market in terms of the inflation, but we continued to grow the volumes relative to the market over the full year, that 1.7% that Dave spoke about
  -0.20  0 So we have got a boring question for Alan, IFRS 16 will be implemented in January '19
  -0.09  0 And can you give us a feeling of the increase of the NPV of the operating lease following IFRS 16?  I can answer part of that question
  -0.09  0 Very deep in the detail of the press release, we've confirmed that we will adopt the fully retrospective basis for IFRS 16
  -0.11  1 We feel that this best aligns the future with the past and gives the best reference point for the comparison as we go and we restate
   0.20  0 It's effective in the '19, '20 year, so the year we've just entered will be the comparative year
  -1.00  0 We will be restating
  -0.08  0 But we should still go find increase in your operating lease commitment and when you will use IFRS 16 compared to what you published today?  The way we disclose our -- yes, there are differences
  -0.09  0 And under the current lease obligations, the standards require that we take the lease obligations and discount them to lease breaks
   0.14  0 IFRS 16 puts the asset on to the balance sheet effectively forever, and that will be a change
  -1.00  0 I just had a question for Charles
  -0.20  0 It's kind of a bit of a hypothetical question
   0.07  0 But what is the operating leverage effect in the Booker business for incremental unit of growth that you've seen over the years?  It's not a hypothetical question because it's easier to draw off history
   0.00  1 So we -- where we were converting was pretty much 10% growth in earnings would -- 10% growth in sales would equate to about a 12%   growth in earnings, which would come through to the cash bottom line pretty hard and fast
  -0.50  0 A question around procurement
   0.00  1 Hope it meets your expectations in terms of quality
   0.08  0 I think it's fair to say that always, when something like this happens, there is an element of looking at the price file and looking at the relative prices between the 2 businesses and seeing where there are opportunities
   0.50  0 And then there has to be a conversation about how things like that can be resolved
   0.06  0 So the bit that I would say before I pass to Jason to give you a little bit more insight into it is if I were a supplier and I was sitting here now, I would be sitting at home saying just a second, I've got the largest retailer in the U.K
   0.00  1 that's growing again
   0.00  1 that continues to grow very strongly
   0.00  1 And they are saying that their own aspiration is to grow another GBP 2.5 billion in revenue
   0.20  0 I'd be sitting down thinking how it is I align my plans with the opportunity that, that full channel business affords me and actually how can I change my business to work with that more efficiently and better
   0.08  0 I've said before, when I -- the happy days were when I was a Chairman of the Unilever in the U.K., Tesco will by far in a way my toughest partner in terms of negotiation
   0.00  1 They got the best terms
   0.11  0 And that's part of where we want to be with all of our supply partners and coming together with Booker doesn't change that, it just enhances it
  -0.50  0 Is that enough warning, Mr
  -0.14  0 Tarry?  Yes, as I have a cough you've seem to have answered the question and definitely are up to it
  -0.25  1 I think the good -- I think it's a good question
  -0.12  0 I think it's worthwhile outlining approach actually which is we met the suppliers in Bar Hill very deliberately because what we wanted to do is talk to them about growth and talk to them about speed and show them some tangible examples of that
   0.19  0 But actually, that is -- the approach is very much to focus on the growth opportunities, the bigger, holistic opportunity, and let's get going quickly in that speed into getting after those growth opportunities together
   0.00  1 I think your   point is well around reach is very interesting
   0.00  1 And if you actually add up the distribution points, either directly or indirectly through Charles' customer base, it does give us quite unparalleled reach in the U.K
    nan  1  Good
  -0.17  0 So why is that figure so low when the equalization should be so much higher?  I think we will have -- and I suspect we will have a more detailed conversation about it, David
  -0.10  0 We've got to remember, it's always with the supplier to set the price of their product, now as we can ask, but there is a subject to negotiation
  -0.25  0 One question and a very short follow-up, if I'm allowed
  -0.20  0 The question is, you've talked quite a lot about first half, second half shape of last year in the U.K
  -0.05  1 At this stage, I can't break that down, I won't break that down, it's going to be as a combined business, because I absolutely want to keep the businesses together, it's a new opportunity that comes from both being together, so it's GBP 2.5 billion for the combined group
   0.33  0 Whatever profit you generate out of GBP 2.5 billion..
   0.33  0 So GBP 25 million profit out of GBP 2.5 billion..
   0.00 -1 So I think the market stays competitive in that sense
   0.00 -1 So that's a feature, that's a new headwind, if you like, that will -- the industry will see a little bit of as we go forward and we've got plans to sort of mitigate that
   0.00  1 So the only new feature I see going forward is that unique dynamic we have about what the right distribution and logistics make a business as we bring the groups together and there's a lot of detailed work going on, on that
   0.11  0 So people will talk about points of inflation, if I look at where we are in terms of price relatively as we exited our financial year, happy where we were
   0.09  0 There's still some pressure there, so we'll be in the usual game of deciding actually how it is we can manage, invest, deliver the profit
   0.00  1  But in terms of shape, first half, second half, what we've done is we've grown and we've grown
  -0.11  0 Your retail free cash flow, GBP 1.4 billion in the year, included GBP 500 million working cap and almost GBP 400 million from disposals
   0.00 -1 So there were some and there's potential outflows in relation to the HMRC
   0.00  1 But overall, I think the way that I think about it is grow the operating cash from the business; manage the cash flow on CapEx, which we had a bit of an outflow last year, the GBP 200 million that I mentioned
   0.11  0 But generally, I would expect and hope that, providing our CapEx is stable year-on-year, our cash utilization should be pretty much the same year-on-year
   0.00 -1 And then just again a flag, this is going to impact everybody in the market, HMRC and the U.K
   0.06  0 are bringing forward the payment on account regime, and we will impact -- and that's effectively a payment outflow from a working capital perspective and that will impact over the next couple of years
   0.00  1 I think this year was -- in fact, there   were some favorable elements in it
    nan  1  Very good
   0.05 -1 So I'm just wondering what's happening there, because obviously the profit is growing, forget the margin, as absolute currency adjusted profit is growing and there you've got some very, very weak underlying like-for-like unless something else going on there that I'm missing
  -0.33  0  So I suppose a simple question
   0.00  1 What's the underlying like-for-like within Asia?  If you strip out the numbers, I'm looking at Tony if he wants to add something as we talk, I think we see at the moment and again, if I look at the last month, which is on my mind, I think our food sales are up over 3% like-for-like in Asia as we come out the annualizing of that, the market is deflating
  -0.03  1 But in the core bits of the turnaround of the Thai business and the restructuring of the whole proposition, if I look at core food, last 4 weeks, 3.2% like-for-like gives you the best indication, stripping out all the bulk and the couponing and was that -- Tony, do you want to say anything else on top of that?  Like before I think you've answered it, but I think it will be just to reiterate, this is a volume recovery volume growth and quality of growth going forward, big traditional market which is about half the market
   0.10  0 And part of that sale that you've seen come out was driving that market was going into that market and wasn't profitable
  -0.05  0 Similar to the GBP 1.5 billion target that you have out there, can I clarify that the GBP 175 million target is your gross savings target from the Booker merger, which, of course, you will probably beat and you'll probably retain, but just to check that, the GBP 175 million is gross rather than the net?  Correct
   0.50  0 Please?  James Grzinic from Jefferies
  -0.50  0 Very quick question, strategic question really
   0.00  1 We've closed unprofitable stores, we're thinking about different propositions that can work better in a couple of those key markets
   0.00  1  Very clear
   0.11  0 And are you working on a new discount chain for the U.K?  Never ever comment on any innovation ever
   0.08  0 And I'll give the qualification to that because people always -- you get into a no-win situation, which is while he didn't say this or he did say that and people second guess and you get yourself into all sorts of thing
  -0.33  0 So hopefully, we've answered all of your questions
   0.00  1 Thank you very much for listening
   0.00  1 So thank you very much for your time and your attention

   0.33  0 Today, we are announcing our first annual profit since 2008
   0.00 -1 We still have costly legacy issues to resolve, in particular, the U.S
   0.00 -1 The GRG 166 report published in Parliament on Tuesday made uncomfortable reading, and we have apologized to customers who were not well treated
  -0.07  0 We set up a complaint scheme overseen by an independent former High Court judge, which is working through individual cases, and we've already undertaken an automatic refund of complex fee arrangements
  -0.14  0 We've provided GBP 400 million for that redressed activity in 2016, which is when we first saw the report
   0.00 -1 As well as rebuilding trust, we must also accelerate our transition to digital banking
   0.00 -1 The regulatory outcome remains uncertain
   0.08  0 The timing of its implementation will depend on the nature and length of the transition period, on which we expect to hear more from the government and the European Commission soon
   0.00  1 But in spite of these challenges, we are confident that the bank is now in good shape for the future
   0.33  0 Most of the legacy issues have now been resolved
   0.00  1  Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 This morning's results show that the strategy that we've built for this bank back in 2014 is working
   0.00  1 Our costs are down again
   0.00  1 And lastly, but I think really importantly, our colleague engagement is at a 10-year high despite significant restructuring in all of our businesses
   0.20 -1 This investment and innovation will slow our progress on cost reduction in the medium term before we see the benefits in the latter years
   0.00  1 Our performance reflects the economies that we serve
   0.00 -1 In January, approvals returned to trend with volumes in line with 2017, but with considerable pressure on new business margins
   0.00 -1 Margin pressure in the mortgage market continued throughout 2017
   0.12  0 And despite a base rate rise in November, average mortgage rates are at or close to historic lows
   0.00  1 Set against this backdrop, our income and lending growth shows how getting the customer experience right can drive returns despite a very challenging market
   0.00 -1 The appetite for new lending in the U.K
   0.50  0 businesses were stable across 2017
   0.00  1 Again, our lending performance reflects, first, with growth and targeted segments, offset reductions in other areas, as we focus our capital on where we can see scope for sustainable long-term returns
   0.00 -1 and the EU post-Brexit are affecting our client's investment decisions
   0.00 -1 Given this and the wider macroeconomic environment, we remain cautious in our outlook, while maintaining prudent lending standards and strong relationships with our customers
   0.00  1 To reiterate, we are growing in the markets that we like, and we are within our risk appetite
   0.33  0 A pretax profit of GBP 2.2 billion for the bottom line profit of GBP 752 million
   0.00  1 For the fourth consecutive year, we have exceeded our cost reduction target for the full year of GBP 810 million reduction compared to our target of GBP 750 million
   0.00  1 We have now reduced costs by GBP 3.9 billion in 4 years
   0.00  1 Underpinning this bank are some of the best brands and customer franchises in the marketplace
   0.00  1 PBB delivered GBP 31 billion of gross, new mortgage lending in 2017, and took its share of new mortgage market to 12%, supporting growth in stock share to 10%
   0.00  1 Commercial Banking remains ahead of its main competitors on customer efficacy in 2017 with a Net Promoter Score of plus 21
   0.00  1 We expect operating costs in the markets division to reduce significantly over the next few years as we wind up the historic [ Caprice ] asset and continue to reshape this business
   0.00 -1 In 2017, RBS International also faced cost headwinds associated with ring-fencing
   0.00  1 In 2017, our simplification strategy continued
   0.25  0 That was despite the fact that in 2017, 6,600 of our colleagues left the bank
   0.29 -1 Despite our good progress on simplifying the business, we still are far too complex
   0.00  1 We want to dramatically increase the advances we've already made in areas like artificial intelligence
   0.00  1 Secondly, developing a nimbler, more flexible operating model
  -0.07  0 This will impact our cost reduction in the near term and mean higher restructuring costs, but we retain our sub-50% cost-to-income ratio target to 2020
   0.00  1 Safety and security
   0.00  1 This underpins everything we do for customers
   0.12  0 Research shows that our customers trust us with their information, and they rely on us to deliver for them day in and day out
  -0.25  0 November and December are often our busiest months for retail customers, obviously given the festive period, and we had no critical [ one ] incidents in the bank in these months in 2017, and only 4 in the last 6 months of 2017
   0.00  1 We have a significant responsibility to help keep our millions of customers safe and secure when it comes to their banking
   0.00  1 Simplified and automated
   0.00  1 It reduces costs
   0.00  1 Since 2014, we have seen total payment volumes grow by 5%
   0.00 -1 Yet during this time, branch transactions are down 36%, ATM transactions are down 35% and checks are down 39%
   0.00  1 All of the growth in our payment volumes has come from our digital platforms, where volumes are up 14%
   0.00  1 Customers are using our digital channels at an unprecedented rate
   0.00  1 It's safe
   0.00  1 It's secure, and customers like it
   0.00  1 That's up from 50% just 12 months ago, and we plan to increase this to 85% by the end of 2018
   0.00  1 Digital sales volumes increased 11% in 2017, with personal loans up 20%
   0.00  1 And these are just some of the new products and services that will help customers with their needs on a day-to-day basis
  -0.17  0 Since the first quarter of 2017, Cora has handled over 414,000 customer interactions, answering 228 different questions
   0.00  1 Productivity will increase significantly, as other support functions go through a similar transformation
  -0.12  0 And we've deliberately stayed consistent on how we've talked about our strategy over the last 5 years
   0.00  1 As we look to 2020, we've again set ourselves some ambitious targets centered on our strategic priorities
   0.00 -1 Secondly, costs are down
   0.00  1 Income is up
   0.00  1 We are growing in the markets we like
   0.00  1 And really, importantly, our colleague engagement is very high
   0.00 -1 And the market is more competitive than ever
   0.40  0 We are responding proactively by investing in digital innovation
   0.00  1 Thank you, all
   0.00  1 In summary, a good set of results
   0.00  1 Our best set of full year results for many years
  -0.07  1 As Ross and I set out a year ago, we had 4 objectives for last year: To grow income, to cut costs, to reduce risk-weighted assets and to substantially resolve legacy issues
   0.00  1 On income, adjusted income was up 4%, more than offsetting the pressure we saw on NIM, down 5 basis points over the full year
   0.00 -1 Our adjusted cost income ratio fell from 66% to 58%
   0.00 -1 On RWAs, they were down GBP 27 billion, a 12% reduction
   0.00 -1 And that included a GBP 21 billion reduction or 11% in our core business
  -0.10  1 As you recall, we set us over a target of a GBP 20 billion gross reduction now to the end of 2018, so we're a year ahead of schedule on that
   0.11  0 And adjusting for the 30 basis points of pro forma benefit from IFRS 9 on the 1st of January, we'd be at 16.2%
   0.00 -1 That's down 3/4 from where that ratio stood just 4 years ago
   0.12  0 And as you can see from today's results, we are continuing to also resolve other legacy conduct issues
   0.00  1 Another key milestone in 2017, all 3 agencies now have a holdco senior ratings as investment grade
  -0.20  0 That was driven by GBP 1.3 billion of restructuring and conduct costs
  -0.20  0 And it's seasonally normally the weakest quarter for NatWest markets, as it was again in 2017
  -0.22  0 There were a number of larger one-offs in our Q4 income: GBP 173 million IFRS volatility charge, GBP 112 million of Capital Resolution disposable losses, and the previously disclosed GBP 161 million gain on sale from us selling our stake in [ Euroclear ]
   0.00  1 Excluding the impact of the bank levy, adjusted costs in the quarter were up GBP 122 million
   0.08  0 That included the non-repeat of GBP 55 million of VAT and other releases that were in Q3, together with increased investment innovation and marketing spend in the quarter
   0.00 -1 Cost reduction for us is very closely correlated to headcount reduction, and this continues to fall, down 2,400 FTEs or 3.3% in the quarter and an 8% reduction over the full year
  -0.17  0 Impairments were higher in the quarter, sub GBP 234 million or 29 basis points
  -0.10  0 Firstly, higher impairments in Commercial Banking, with a very few specific large off -- one-off items, responsible for nearly all of the total provision
  -0.17  0 There were GBP 531 million of restructuring charges in the quarter and GBP 764 million of conduct costs
  -0.12  1 We also now expect restructuring charges to be around GBP 1.5 billion higher over 2018 and '19 relative to previous guidance
   0.00  1 So as you model forward, we see some modest income growth across personal and business banking and commercial and private banking as a core part of delivering our 2020 sub 50% cost income ratio
   0.00 -1 Secondly, operating costs will be down this year, but the rate of reduction will be lower than last year
   0.11  0 Accelerated investment and innovation spend, we're planning to be up about 30% on the spend relative to last year
   0.00 -1 There's higher operating costs, driven by ring-fencing, and Brexit and some higher inflation than previous assumptions
   0.00  1 So while the gross costs take out this year will still be significant, the overall cost reduction from 2017 to 2018 will be materially lower
   0.00  1 We think though we did a very strong track record on costs, just as a reminder, GBP 4 billion of costs out in the last 4 years, that's over 1/3 of our cost base
  -0.09  1 Ross and I remain very focused on taking costs out as quickly as we can without damaging our customer franchises or our controlled environment
   0.00  1 By 2020, we are committing to reduce our all-in cost income ratio below 50%
  -0.07  1 Thirdly, on restructuring costs, we are guiding for these to be materially higher, but we think, largely for the right reasons, that should be viewed as helping deliver much lower operating costs by 2020 and beyond
  -0.20  0 Restructuring costs for this were not on the previous guidance
   0.00  1 We think this will help drive a significant cost take out opportunity for us and is very value accretive restructuring spend
  -0.14  0 Of the remaining GBP 1.2 billion of additional restructuring costs, around 2/3 of that is for accelerated transformation
   0.00  1 We do believe this is in the long-term interest of shareholders and the bank
   0.00  1 And we expect it will deliver over the longer term a much more flexible and lower cost base
  -0.14  0 For the remainder, we are guiding to some higher costs on existing restructuring
   0.00 -1 These primarily relate to higher costs associated with the implementation of ring-fencing and preparations for Brexit and higher costs in relation to some of the countries and properties we are exiting
   0.00 -1 Fourthly, we continue to be cautious on how quickly higher conduct costs will tail off, as evidenced by a number of smaller conduct costs we saw in our Q4 results
   0.00 -1 Away from the DOJ settlement, we expect there still to be ongoing significant conduct costs in 2018 and 2019, before tailing off in 2020 to a lower level
   0.00 -1 And lastly, as I'll now turn to, we think RWAs through 2020 will be lower than currently modeled in consensus
  -0.08  0 On core Tier 1, as you can see on the slide, we think we've given you most of the inputs you need with our 2020 financial targets and our restructuring cost guidance
   0.04  0 There is really just 2 large items for you to be modeling away from this, in addition to some further smaller conduct costs: firstly, the eventual final costs of any DOJ settlement; and secondly, the impact on our core Tier 1 of continuing to meet our defined benefit pension obligations
   0.00 -1   We expect RWAs to be GBP 5 billion to GBP 10 billion lower by this year-end
   0.06  0 For us, we think that represents a combination of higher credit and operational risk RWAs, and depending on the combined impact of those 2, potentially the impact of the outlook floor
  -0.07  0 And as per our outlook, given the number of material parts, I've just -- moving parts I've just covered, and greater [ CET1 ] stress volatility that's caused as a result of IFRS 9
   0.00  1 We're growing volumes
   0.00  1 We're growing income
   0.00 -1 We're not stretching risk appetite
   0.00  1 We're continuing to drive absolute costs down
   0.00  1 This in turn is driving significant operating leverage
   0.00 -1 Our adjusted cost income ratio fell from 66% to 58% last year
   0.00  1 Together with materially lower RWAs, adjusted returns grew to 8.8%, but we still recognize we've got a lot to do over the coming years
   0.00  1 Our 2020 target is to exceed 12%
   0.00  1 We're now accelerating investment in transforming the bank
  -0.07  1 But the cost of this transformation resulting in a more flexible and lower longer- term cost base will be higher investment and restructuring costs in the near term
   0.00 -1 You know the issues that we've got ahead of us
   0.00  1 As a reminder, we have various members of our executive team in the first row who are also delighted to take some of your questions
  -0.25  0 Let's move straight to questions
  -0.20  0 I warn you, we will have some on the web probably, but we'll go in the hall first
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.25  0  It has to be within the 228 questions then, Michael, and I'll give you 414,000 answers
  -0.50  0 That's question 1
   0.00 -1 But clearly, you [ pushed ] your costs up a bit
   0.00  1 And the market is moving very quickly
  -0.12  0 I've always said to the team, don't worry about it, we'll quietly build it
   0.00  1 So we're definitely ahead of the pack in terms of the delivery of those
   0.00  1 And I think, as Ross said earlier, the investment has been made over the last 4, 5 years has given us a solid foundation where we once had one that was very fragile
  -0.33  0 You don't go from over 300 criticality one outages to a period of 120 days without one without engineering in some capabilities
   0.00 -1 And one of the things that I've observed historically is that the cost is often taken out of organizations through, actually, the underinvestment in the infrastructure
   0.00  1 But I think it's a very solid foundation to actually deliver a bunch of very good [ competitive ] capabilities in open banking world
  -0.14  0 So -- well, without sounding excessively defensive, we're still -- we are undertaking to take out GBP 1.2 billion of costs over the next 3 years to get to the GBP 6.4 billion consensus, which is still significantly more than other U.K
   0.00  1 This is the third year in a row we've grown GBP 1.4 billion, GBP 1.5 billion, GBP 1.6 billion
   0.00 -1 So I think people were skeptical a couple of years ago about our ability to continue to deliver that
   0.00  1 I think it's our third year in a row, so people should take some comfort from that
   0.00  1  Thanks
  -0.08  0 So on the current consensus, this is sitting about GBP 6.4 billion for adjusted operating costs, a couple of hundred million for conduct, and well under GBP 100 million for restructuring charges
  -0.08  0 Some of the residual deficit you get to, we're assuming does get met through investment return, and some of it will be made up of additional contributions
   0.00  1  Thanks
   0.00  1 Thank you
   0.00 -1 Because although NIM has obviously stabilized in the fourth quarter, it was like loan growth is a little bit weaker
  -0.33  0 I also just want you to clarify, in the second question
  -0.07  0 So Les, do you want to start on mortgages or do you want Alison to start on?    Yes, I mean I think as far as mortgage is concerned, you saw us growing at 7% last year with the market at about 3%
   0.00 -1 Forward flow share was a bit lower in Q4 at about 12
   0.00 -1 What we don't want to do is pull pricing down in the marketplace
   0.00  1 So from a PBB perspective, Europe, you're still seeing pretty good volume
   0.00  1 On the unsecured side, we're seeing good loan growth, but our credit cards is still an area that we're -- that's relatively flat or slightly down
   0.00  1  Thanks
   0.00  1 Deposit growth has also continued to be very strong
   0.00  1 And surprisingly, given that the interest rate environment, [ but it has been ] very strong
   0.00  1 On the commercial side, we're continuing to see growth in targeted segments
   0.00  1 So what you've seen through the course of this year is really robust capital discipline, making sure we're growing in the areas we want to
   0.00  1 So we've had good like-for-like growth in our commercial areas, so-called small commercial up to mid-corporate
   0.00  1 Very disciplined use of capital in our large corporate space, and we'll continue to have that view into this year
   0.00  1 So we expect to continue to grow at or above market in our chosen segments
   0.00  1 We're still seeing that momentum
   0.00  1 In terms of pricing, you've seen through the course of this year good pricing discipline applied across our asset book
   0.17  0 That is continuing to attain, and we'll continue to test that going forward
   0.00  1 That will continue to accelerate within very tight risk appetite areas
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.33  0 Ewen, there was a second question?  Yes
  -0.05  0 On the RWA question, I mean what principally drives -- I mean there are obviously some RWAs associated with the portfolio, so what principally drives the RWA reduction is the continued rundown of the ex-Capital Resolution assets
   0.33  0 I've got 2, please
   0.00  1 But I think what we are seeing is a combination of actually structural hedging now where we are with the structural hedge and base rate increased expectations that the competitive pressures we are seeing in the mortgage market are largely getting offset by increased spreads in our liability margins
  -0.10  0 And then the second one, I guess a little bit more detail, but also for Ross, is to understand where the incremental restructuring or, let's say, investment is going into within the IT budget
  -0.67  0 We are certainly investigating that in a serious way
  -0.17  0 Now is that a restructuring or is that a -- because we moved -- digitized more that we just don't need it is that balance
  -0.12  0 And so we've got a number of initiatives underway currently which we're looking to exploit that
   0.00  1 We've built a pretty decent network to scout new capabilities well so alongside that
   0.00  1 So it's sort of combination of acceleration of really the refresh of our underlying infrastructure and the facility it sits in, and then ways of working and the way that we utilize new capabilities to compete
   0.00  1 But we have allowed the business over the next 12 to 18 months to pick up on a number of those sorts of initiatives that I think will, long-term, add some real value to the business
   0.00 -1 But unless this business starts thinking forward on where its customers want to deal, we just don't have the growth going forward
  -0.50  0 And the same for the restructuring charge
  -0.14  0 I mean we've obviously got big restructuring charges the next couple of years
   0.00  1 Some of the property costs were much higher than what we'd even anticipated at the start, but the pace with which we've gone through and removed our colleagues out of the businesses, we've reshaped, and it has been quicker as well
   0.00 -1 So I think that has been a bit of a surprise
  -0.25  0 But today, we have to really seriously consider
   0.00  1 And there are some pretty chunky costs there, but some nice savings we make over that as well
   0.00 -1  And the assumption, Tom, is that we're going to have to continue to drive cost down on nominal terms beyond 2020
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.20  0 I'll stay on the same theme, please
  -0.40  0 The second question will then be, you've guided to high restructuring charges in 2018 and '19
  -0.10  0 You're talking about potentially high 6s for 2020 all-in costs, another give or take GBP 0.5 billion restructuring cost in 2020
  -0.20  0 Does that then -- okay, please correct me if I'm wrong
  -0.14  0 Or should we think of restructuring costs more like being a strategic investment and therefore continues?  No
   0.17  0 So you're in a different cost base position at that point
  -0.05  0 And that's the thing we've sort of questioned ourselves, because if you took it all as we're moving to a digital world, we're probably spending GBP 1.5 billion to GBP 2 billion a year on the bank moving to digital by taking out physical
   0.00  1 So it's quite hard, but we are spending a lot on our technology now that we're in much better shape
  -0.08  0  And Andy, I think we also -- we want to sort of -- Ross and I want to move away from trying to distinguish between whether some things are restructuring costs or investment costs
  -0.04  0 But I think the other thing that we're trying to tell you as part of what we're doing is, we're really trying to shift the cost base, which is quite a heavy fixed cost base today, there's a fixed cost infrastructure that we're dealing within technology and property and people, to a much more flexible variable cost base in the future
   0.20  0 I just wanted to circle back on margins, please
   0.00 -1 I think in the past, you talked about a 40 basis point differential between your front-book mortgage pricing and your back-book mortgage pricing, creating a 4 to 5 basis point headwind to NIM per quarter from a REIT
   0.00 -1  Look, I think, you -- we have seen a -- in the fourth quarter, you have seen a further reduction
   0.00 -1 We are starting to see finally -- I mean, I made the comment that we're seeing some of the lowest margins in this business at the moment that have been here for a long period of time, but we are starting to see a couple of the bigger players starting to push the pricing back up again
  -0.12  0 I had a question for you on NatWest Markets, which was -- thank you for splitting out the legacy and the core business there
  -0.10  0 Maybe you got smart [indiscernible] going to be quite durable, maybe some cost, and it might take a little more time to squeeze out
   0.07  0 You know sort of GBP 1.3 billion to GBP 1.4 billion revenue is produced over GBP 1.5 billion, which has been great, but lot of work, so maybe talk about what's coming out from the old Caprice?  Sure
  -0.10  0 I mean I'll try and answer you, directly your question because it's a bit more broadly about our risk markets
   0.00 -1 It's not -- the costs really aren't that high
   0.12  0 There's about 100 people transferred in to NatWest Markets from Capital Resolution who are managing those positions
   0.11  0 The nature of the kind of positions they are, meaning that they are very similar to the kind of the things we're doing at NatWest Markets anyway
   0.00 -1 So the cost will go down as we reduce those exposures, including there's some lumpy elements to it, like Alawwal, which Ewen has already mentioned, which is obviously a very significant component part of it
  -0.05  1 So yes, it has a drag, but it's in the plan, and always was in the plan within the numbers since we sort of started and did an analyst presentation back in '15, and those numbers really haven't changed, other than the fact, as Ewen mentioned earlier, we've been increasing revenues year-on-year
   0.00  1 So you've seen in the last couple of years that we've been trending above what we said we hope to be able to do
   0.00  1 And the costs -- the cost reduction across the businesses is on plan and continues to be so
   0.00 -1 And once that starts to reduce, which it will do pretty significantly after '19, then obviously the cost base comes down
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.29  0 And we'll take a question from the online, there are a couple actually, but quite quick
  -0.50  0 On the first question of when
   0.00  1 I think some of this will be competed away in lower price, it's just the reality of a very well-functioning market
   0.00  1 Those are the things we're looking at to actually grow our revenue pools as well
  -0.11  1 But I think there are some areas that we can, we're investigating that actually can help grow our revenues because of the data we get
   0.00  1 And that's really important
   0.00 -1 So you'll see some investments that we'll do that are around the data and retention or getting more data so we can put better propositions to customers as well, because without that data, I think there will be problems
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.50  0 Just a couple of quick questions
   0.00 -1 But certainly, the trajectory through until you get on to mortgage floors should be down and comfortably down from where current consensus is
  -0.17  0 We've got some small areas of commercial that we still want to divest
  -0.08  0  What do you think your cash tax rates during that period of time when you use unrealized losses will be?  We don't have a lot of benefit from unrealized losses
   0.00  1 Thank you
    nan  1 Good
   0.00  1 Thanks
   0.18  0 But what I want to know is how confident you are of getting down to 13% by 2020, which presumably drives your maths for the greater than 12% ROTE target?  No, it doesn't
   0.00 -1 But the -- I mean, there's a number of variables which I talked about earlier that we just don't know today
  -0.12  0 So that should allow us, if you go back philosophically to how we think about capital, we want under extreme stress to have a core Tier 1 no less than 9%
  -0.20  0 And then we build out from there in terms of what the appropriate stress buffer is
  -0.20  0 We have the impact of IFRS 9, which will increase risk volatility
  -0.22  1 I mean, my assumption is that as we get to understand IFRS 9 over time, we'll be able to reduce that stress volatility
  -0.15  0 And we also have, obviously, a period after 2022 where we get the ability for -- where you're not going to get the full impact of the IFRS 9 volatility anyway in your stress testing
   0.09  0 So it's a complex story of which why I've just signaled it, for the time being, we're going to be above 13% I think until we understand some of those offsets and trade-offs better
   0.00  1  Thanks
   0.33  0 I've got 2, please
  -0.20  0 You had some pretty big closures just in the tail end of last year
  -0.09  0 And if that's just because you don't quite know what the investment costs will be or you don't know whether you can turn off legacy systems, I guess
   0.00  1  I think Ewen gave you pretty good guidance around what 2020 costs would look like
  -0.20  0 I like that word, "abandoned." Thankfully, I just haven't given you the target this year
   0.00 -1 We have to keep taking costs out of this business
   0.00  1 And my executive team sitting in the front row know that well and truly clearly
   0.00  1 So one of the things we're trying to do is to give us more flexibility to actually manage the bank for value than GBP 6.4 billion all-in cost target would have given us
   0.00  1 Ewen's right, there are some things we want to invest and we think would be good for the bank longer term
  -0.25  0 I know we do quarterly results, but I'd love to stop doing those
   0.00  1 We should be just getting to a longer-term approach, which is really   good for customers and for our shareholders at the end of the day
  -0.06  0 And then in the next year, we came in and we closed that one, and they said, "Hold on, why didn't you tell us you we're going to close that one as well?" And that was starting to happen more and more, so we were really upsetting our customers by sending them somewhere only to finally closed on them
  -0.12  0 We have still got to deal with the -- what are -- we were going to call Williams & Glyn branches, 275 of them, they were -- they needed not to drop below 275, so that's why they're on the shape
  -0.10  0 So we are making quite big changes in there which allows customers to go into other branches and be served, so some pretty big things have been done in the last couple of years
   0.00  1  We're running tight on time, so straight behind you, thanks
  -0.50  0 Couple of questions
  -0.11  0 And just on the final point in relation to the 2021 move on the back of the impending Basel III reforms
  -0.09  0 Second question is, in relation to the Ulster Bank sale process or -- not that one has necessarily begun, but your reference to that as a potential large portfolio sale process later this year
   0.17  0 Just getting to understand better what drove that change in TAC essentially
   0.00 -1 It's down to about 16.7% non-performing
  -0.20  0 Our view was we wanted to get it back into earnings volatility
   0.00 -1 And to do that, we needed to get the non-performings down, reworked the cost base of that business, so it was our plan anyway
  -0.07  0 And then we'll look and see whether we take out the portfolios, whether it's a value to you to take other portfolios or whether we let market increases of growing the good book versus the flow of the others will now get us to 5 for the next 3 to 4 years, I suspect it would
   0.00  1 But we just want a nice clean bank in Ireland
   0.00 -1 It's a pretty tough market over there from a regulatory and government perspective
   0.00  1 So we're trying to create a good simple business
   0.00 -1 The NPL is getting down
   0.14  0 We do think it's a material number, so we do think it's beneficial to talk about it
  -0.60  0 The claims inquiry is pretty volatile at the moment
   0.00 -1 Which magazine put out some stuff on PPI, it went up again and came down again
   0.00  1  Thank you
   0.00  1 Thanks
  -0.20  0 I just had a question about the kind of health of the U.K
   0.00 -1 Your comments seem pretty good, but then you mentioned that Brexit has led to some corporates changing behavior
   0.00 -1 You obviously had a lot of profit warnings in the U.K
  -0.10  0 I'm just wondering, things seem fine right now, but how are you thinking about kind of the next 6 months as you get corporates and how healthy they are and what kind of loan losses you could see
  -0.33  0 And the second question, just on the investment
  -0.13  0 Because it sounds a lot like the investments just stop, the digitalization process happening at the moment from big banks to losing a lot of their margins, or is that a wrong way to think about it?  I'm going to ask Alison to talk a little bit about health of corporate sector briefly
   0.09 -1 We've seen real pressure in the outsourcing sector and the construction sector, which we're keeping a very close eye on
  -0.12  0 So we have [indiscernible] risk appetite in different sectors just beyond high alert to some of the macro trends that we might be seeing
  -0.17  1 in good health with some warning signs in some of the obvious sectors that we've mentioned
  -0.10  0 We are making sure that when we look at -- obviously, we track very closely all the indicators on early warning and profit warnings
   0.11 -1 In terms of Brexit impact and what that's doing to confidence and change of behavior, really, what we're seeing is some of the longer term investment decisions where there is greater uncertainty, maybe a little bit of a pause in that space
   0.00  1 But in the short to medium term, investment trends, particularly in commercial and corporate, remain very high and very normalized
   0.00  1 We happened to have one of the best FX vehicles in the marketplace through NatWest Markets
  -0.17  1 And with our customer base, I think we can do some pretty good things, but it's going to be a slow burn
  -0.14  0  I think we're probably going to have to call it quits at that point, since it's 5 past 11
   0.33  0 Anything you want to say by conclusion?  No
   0.00  1 Look, thank you very much
   0.00  1 It's been 10 very, very hard years
   0.00 -1 I'm not saying it's over, but to finally make a profit, you should not underestimate what that means to 71,000 people in this organization
  -0.20  0 And also, I suspect a lot of the public at large have put a lot of money in
   0.00  1 Our costs are down, our income is up, our capital has been built well
   0.00  1 We are building a simple, safe bank
   0.00  1 And finally, we're doing our job
   0.00  1 So thank you very much
   0.00  1  Thank you

---FILE: Unilever PLC.txt

   0.00  1 Paul will give the headlines of the performance for the year and talk about how Connected 4 Growth is building more agility, speed and resilience into our business
   0.20  0 We'll leave plenty of time for Q&A
  -0.10  0 First, I draw your attention to the disclaimer relating to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures
   0.00  1 It was another year of major transformation for Unilever, which already started in 2010
   0.00  1 Firstly, a more nimble organization, including the introduction of the new Country Category Business Teams
   0.00  1 Now secondly, the accelerated evolution of our portfolio and channels, both organically and through M&A, is also unprecedented
  -0.14  0 We also did 5 new brand introductions, and we did the landmark disposal of our spreads business following the carve-out over the last few years
   0.00  1 These are all accelerating the rate at which we are taking out cost from our business, certainly, the costs that we believe do not add value
   0.00  1 And together with the investments we've made over the last few years, they are certainly helping us to provide the fuel for both quality growth as well as margin expansion
  -0.07  0 Now when making such fundamental changes, the challenge is always to keep the car going at full speed, whilst you're also tuning the engine, if you allow me to use this well-used analogy
   0.00  1 So I think it is a testament to the agility of our people that we have done all of this while still delivering very good all- around performance in 2017
   0.00  1 In fact, underlying sales grew by 3.5% in the year, excluding spreads
   0.00  1 Volume growth was 1%
   0.00  1 Underlying operating margin increased showed -- increasingly also showed a step-up
   0.00  1 We realized more than EUR 2 billion of savings from the 5-S and the ZBB program, and reinvesting actually a little over 2/3 of this back into the business
   0.00  1 We think that this level is both competitive in this environment and, indeed, sustainable in the long term
   0.00  1 This led to another year where our share of spend and share of market was comfortably above 100
  -0.25  1 We are well on track towards our objective of a 20% margin by 2020
   0.00  1 Underlying operating earnings per share also grew by 11%
   0.00  1 And we delivered another step-up in cash generation, with free cash flow up by EUR 600 million to a record EUR 5.4 billion, even after counting in the additional EUR 600 million that we put in our pension fund, which is now more or less balanced
   0.00  1 So I think you'll agree that this is a good all-around performance in 2017, and Graeme will cover this as usual in more detail
   0.00  1 Consumer demand measured in volume grew by less than 1%, even allowing for growth in new channels, which are not picked up in most of the market data
   0.00  1 Global GDP grew at 2.9% in 2017 and is forecast to pick up to about 3.2% in 2018
   0.00  1 And there are brighter prospects for India
   0.00 -1 It is normal for there to be a lag between improving economies and the growth in our categories
   0.00 -1 At the same time, there remains a high level of uncertainty in many countries
   0.00 -1 And the trends for more natural, organic, free-from authentic products is only accelerating
   0.00  1 The emergence of new distribution channels offers the potential for our brands to reach more directly and deeply than ever before
   0.15  0 And yes, there remains plenty of white space with new consumers and new segments in emerging markets, particularly as economics improve and new markets open up
   0.00  1 The fundamentals of our business model and the changes we are making through our Connected 4 Growth programs are helping us to adapt to and seize these enormous opportunities
   0.00  1 We've changed the way we innovate quite significantly
   0.00  1 At the same time, we're addressing key local consumer trends with more relevance and more speed than ever
   0.20  0 In fact, these innovations like Cif are now in 15 markets or more
   0.00  1 The Pure Leaf pop-up has really helped the brand and its brand equity, and the same is the case for many of our other brands
   0.14  0 This has led, for example, to 6 new organic brand launches this year alone in 2017, like Love Beauty and Planet, a premium personal care range in the U.S.; or Red Red, a vegan, gluten-free snack pot inspired by a popular dish in Ghana launching now in the U.K
   0.06  0 By 2019, these acquisitions alone will add about EUR 3.5 billion of turnover, with EUR 3 billion of these in home and Personal Care, EUR 2 billion in premium positions, EUR 1.5 billion in emerging markets and nearly EUR 1 billion through e-commerce
  -0.09  0 Now we expect that the combined impact of these acquisitions and the disposal, including spreads, will add around 1% to our ongoing underlying sales growth by 2019
   0.00  1 Good morning, everyone
   0.00  1 All of our categories grew as did all of our subcategories except for spreads, and the step-up in margin was broad-based
   0.00  1 Personal Care grew by 2.9%
   0.00  1 The core of our PC business continued to grow competitively
   0.00  1 Dove, which is our largest brand, now over EUR 4.5 billion, grew 6%
   0.00  1 Our acquisitions in Personal Care contributed increasingly to USG through the year as we started to anniversary them
   0.00  1 Dollar Shave Club and Kate Somerville grew in double digits, while Dermalogica grew at 5%
   0.00 -1 Sales in Murad, on the other hand, were down as we restructured our sales profile by reducing the brand's dependence on the infomercial channel
   0.00  1 Living Proof and Hourglass are both growing at double digits and will begin to contribute to underlying sales growth in 2018
   0.00  1 The underlying operating margin for Personal Care increased by 110 basis points to 21%, already reaching our 2020 target margin for this category
   0.00  1 Home Care grew by 4.4%, with 130 basis point increase in underlying operating margin
   0.00  1 Comfort fabric conditioners continue to grow strongly
   0.00  1 Foods, excluding spreads, grew by 2.2%
   0.00  1 Underlying operating margin increased by 60 basis points
   0.00  1 Knorr grew by 4%, driven by strong growth for cooking products in emerging markets
   0.00  1 with a low-calorie, high-protein proposition
   0.00  1 As you'll have seen, we had a significant pick up in volume and less price growth in the fourth quarter
   0.00 -1 As you know, we benefited from a soft comparator in the fourth quarter last year as we lapped both demonetization in India and a weak Q4 performance in the U.K
   0.00  1 For the full year, our emerging market volume growth was 1.6% and over 4% in the fourth quarter
   0.00 -1 Price growth reduced to 0.7% in the fourth quarter
   0.00  1 The reduction was broad-based across countries and mostly reflects the more benign commodity cost environment that we've signaled previously
   0.00  1 In the first half of the year, commodity costs in local currencies were up by mid- to high single digits
   0.00 -1 But in the second half, this reduced to mid- to low single digits
   0.00  1 Now looking ahead, commodity cost increases will remain relatively low in the first half of 2018, but we do expect the level of commodity cost increases to rise again in the second half of this year
  -0.20  0 At the same time, in Venezuela, inflation escalated to well over 1,000 percentage points in the fourth quarter
   0.17  0 With effect from October, we therefore started to treat price growth in Venezuela as a currency effect and excluded it from underlying sales growth, which, as you know, is calculated at constant exchange rates
   0.00 -1 All of these factors mean that price growth in the first half of 2018 is likely to remain relatively muted
  -0.11  0 M&A increased turnover by 0.9% with acquisitions, partly offset by the disposal of Ades at the end of the first quarter
   0.00 -1 Currency translation reduced turnover by 2.1%
   0.00  1 This was led by our savings programs, which delivered more than EUR 2 billion in the year
   0.00  1 Now this is a little faster than planned and is a very strong start towards our target of EUR 6 billion over the 3 years to 2019
   0.17  0 The level of   reinvestments stepped up progressively through the year in both brand and marketing investment and in pricing
   0.07  0 To put it simply, we used to make too many pieces of traditional TV advertising and we used to take them off-air before they reach their full effectiveness
   0.00  1 We're now making fewer adverts and reinvesting the savings, and showing the best ones for longer, while stepping up our investment in digital media
   0.00 -1 As a result, we continue to be very competitive in our media share of voice
   0.00 -1 As a percentage of sales, brand and marketing investment reduced by 60 basis points
   0.00  1 Overheads reduced by 10 basis points
   0.00  1 Here, the savings have been largely reinvested in building the capabilities, which will drive continued growth into the future
   0.07  0 Now this could be training centers for beauty professionals in Dermalogica, for example, or pop-up in flagship stores that we used to build brand awareness in our Refreshments category
   0.00  1 Underlying earnings per share increased by 11% in both current and in constant rates
   0.00  1 Operational performance, which is the combination of growth and margin, contributed the lion's share of this at 10.4%
   0.00  1 Interest costs on net debt reduced from 3.5% in 2016 to 2.7%, reflecting lower rates on increased borrowings
   0.00 -1 Finally, currency movements decreased EPS by around 0.3%
   0.00  1 The currency effect is more favorable in EPS than on turnover for a number of reasons, including a weaker pound sterling, which reduces the cost expressed in euros of our U.K.-based central costs, such as research and development
  -0.25  0 This included a one-off gain of EUR 578 million from restating deferred tax balances at the new lower U.S
   0.00  1 That's an increase of EUR 600 million on last year
   0.00  1 In spite of an acceleration in M&A activity, our return on invested capital was unchanged at 19.2%, a very high level and well within our targeted high-teens range
   0.00  1 Net debt increased from EUR 12.6 billion at the end of last year to EUR 20.3 billion
  -0.10  0 This includes around EUR 4.4 billion of net investment in acquisitions less disposal proceeds and the impact of the EUR 5 billion share buyback
  -0.11  1   Looking ahead, our plans to tackle the stranded fixed cost as a result of disposal of spreads are well underway
  -0.12  0 We expect to receive net proceeds of around EUR 6 billion when we complete the disposal of spreads
   0.00  1 This was a result both of strong investment returns and the one-off cash injection
   0.00  1 As a result, the financing charge in pensions will reduce from EUR 96 million to around EUR 35 million in 2018
  -0.50  0 There is no doubt that this will be a busy year
   0.12  0 We will complete the integration of the Food & Refreshment and, as well, the completion of the exit from our spreads business
  -0.11  1 But without doubt -- any doubt, our #1 priority remains to grow our volumes ahead of the market, and we are confident that we have the plans in place to just do that
   0.00  1 5-S and Zero Based Budgeting will continue to deliver strong savings, which will be reinvested to provide the fuel for growth
  -0.25  0 Now looking ahead, we do not expect any slowdown in the pace of change around us
   0.00  1 So to wrap up, for 2018, we expect to deliver an underlying sales growth ahead of the market in the 3% to 5% range
  -0.12  0 There will be more restructuring as we start to take out stranded costs from spreads and set up the new Food & Refreshment unit
   0.00  1 We also target another year of strong cash flow
  -0.25  0 And with that, let me start with taking the questions
   0.00  1 Thank you all for listening
  -0.25  0 [Operator Instructions] So I see that our first question is from Jonathan Feeney at Consumer Edge
   0.11  0 First, Paul, you made some comments at the, when we got together back in November, about the easier comparisons in emerging markets in the front half of the year
  -0.08  0 In the second half, first of all, on the commodity side, and Graeme can go into that in more detail, but we see more inflation coming in, in the second half, a function of the current currency movements and our own contracts
   0.00 -1 We also have to deal in the first half, still, some of the effects that are coming in from lower inflation rates, especially in LatAm, that probably will be reflected in lower pricing, which brings me to the question on volume
   0.00  1 And the volume component will definitely be higher than 2017 because, really, of these fundamental changes we've made to Connected 4 Growth
   0.00 -1 Just on the balance of pricing growth, which we said we expect to be a little bit lower in the first half next year than the second half
   0.00 -1 One is actually the Goods and Services Tax implementation in India because in the second half of '17 and, indeed, the first half of '18, that reduces the pricing growth in India, and that has an impact at a Unilever level
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.33  0 The second question comes from Warren Ackerman at SocGen
   0.00  1  Good job today
   0.00 -1 Graeme, at the Q3 stage, you said that you left some [ runs ] in the field and that your competitiveness wasn't as good as expected
   0.14 -1 So whilst the quarter 3 might have been a little softer, quarter 4 is a little better, we look at it at a little bit longer time frame than you sometimes do
  -0.08  0 So what we've seen in the last quarter, and we don't even have the shares yet because they come in with a slight delay, but if you look at the market growth, we estimate that the market growth, all-in, is now about 3%
   0.00  1 But we do see a pickup and we do expect that the quarter 4 volumes that we've put in as well as overall sales growth would result in a increase in the number of businesses building share, and we expect that to continue over the second half
   0.00  1 I was with the [ President Mori ] last week in Davos, and we had good discussions on the direction the country takes
   0.00  1 And then last but not least, and I just wanted to stick to the bigger countries, China, we've seen an acceleration of our growth rates, partly because the market keeps growing
   0.00  1 We had a strong high single digit last quarter there and partly because, obviously, the shifts that have happened in this market, the enormous shifts in this case to e-commerce, it takes a little bit for companies like ours to adjust to that, but we've clearly made these adjustments
   0.00  1 So I'm relatively bullish on some of these markets
   0.00 -1 So South East Asia, I would say, is still the softer part
   0.00  1 And then Latin America, in total, what you have to keep in mind is that, with inflation coming off significantly, and Graeme already alluded to that, we might see higher-quality growth there in terms of the volume component
   0.00 -1 But we certainly will have to compromise on the price component versus 2017
  -0.33  0 Next question is from Celine Pannuti of JPMorgan
  -0.25  0  My first question is on your volume outlook
   0.00 -1 I think there was as well some issues in India all of last year, especially in the first half
   0.09 -1 So I'm a bit surprised by your comment on lower-volume growth in H1, so if you could explain a bit better
  -0.50  0 My second question is on pricing
  -0.09  0 And in there, if you could give us the detail of the contribution from both the M&A and the new brands that were launched in that market?  May I start with the U.S., Celine, and thanks for the questions
  -0.17  0 We've obviously done quite some pricing in the U.S
   0.14  0 86% of the world population, according to an Oxfam study, has not seen any progress
   0.00 -1 So we see our markets actually being fairly subdued, whilst the economy might report good numbers
   0.12  0 growth are numbers that exclude our premium prestige businesses, some of the M&A activity that has come in, in the last year or 2
   0.00 -1 And then last year, obviously, we were hurt by a introduction in ice cream of a competitor that we talked about
  -0.08  1 Whilst our global refreshment unit was the fastest growing unit last year for Unilever with stellar results, by the way, close to 5%, if you want to, the U.S., unfortunately, had to deal with this competitive [ strat ]
   0.07  0 And the second component on the volume part is if you're really look at the effects of the -- in some of the macro changes that are happening in our markets that we have to deal with, I still think it's better more skewed towards the second half that these markets are fully starting to unlock their growth potential because a lot of the markets that we are in have not really done the, how do I call it, the structural reforms that are actually needed
  -0.07  0 One of the things we are pleading for, with many of these governments now is, now that these economies are starting to pick up a little bit that they need to have a little bit more courage, Europe included, to start to drive through these structural reforms
   0.00  1 I think volumes -- and we see this strong volume performance in the fourth quarter
   0.00  1 There's good momentum there
   0.00  1 But it's also good to keep in mind that our volume momentum will already be good over the first half as well, if we didn't communicate that clearly, [indiscernible]
  -0.25  0 Next question comes from James Targett from Berenberg
  -0.50  0 Just one question, really
  -0.07  0 Your intention is to invest the total net proceeds of the spreads sale into buybacks this year and no more and no less than that, can I just be clear?  Martin, what we -- we think we'd get about EUR 6 billion in the middle of the year when spreads closes
   0.29  0 We haven't yet determined how we would do that, but it's dependent on acquisition opportunities
  -0.33  0 And next question is from Eddy Hargreaves from Investec
  -0.12  0 One is following up from Martin's question there, just on timing of that EUR 6 billion- ish buyback
  -0.33  0 And then the second question is just more technical on Venezuela
   0.25  0 Could you confirm or clarify that, please?  Yes
  -0.25  0 The drag is slightly lower, but you are right, so you can do the calculations
   0.17  0 We'll take our time depending on where we are with M&A
   0.00  1 Thanks
  -0.33  0 Next question comes from Reg Watson at ING
   0.00 -1 There seems to be a reigning assumption that you will
   0.09  0 When the revenues come in of the EUR 6 billion of spreads, we'll look at that and in function of many other opportunities that we have in the business, including M&A
  -0.06  1  The divestment of spreads was to reshape the portfolio strategically, and you see the benefit of that in the 1% growth uplift that we'll have in 2019 from the divestment and from the M&A transactions that we've done the acquisitions we've done so far
   0.09  0 And if you have a return on invested capital of 19.2%, I think it would be wise for the bulk of our shareholders to look at opportunities to grow our business and keep it there
  -0.40  0 And just a detail question on the restructuring costs
  -0.17  1 In '17, they were only 10% higher than they were in '16, and yet '17 was the first full year of the major restructuring programs that you're undertaking
  -0.50  0 We expect 2018 to be the major restructuring
  -0.14  0 Obviously, we have certainty now on a big component of that, which is the [ unscheduled ] costs that we have following the spreads disposal, and that's job 1, to get going on that
  -0.20  0 We think we will see the big step-up in restructuring investment in 2018
  -0.09  0 And that is really job 1 for us, to make those changes, focusing on the spreads divestment, et cetera, so look for that to step up
  -0.20  0 Next question is from Karel Zoete from Kepler Cheuvreux
  -0.20  0 And then the second question is on the operating leverage because the volume growth in the Personal Care business was quite okay
   0.20  0 It's Home Care?  Yes, please
   0.00  1 So on Home Care, I think, as you well know, it has been and continues to be our best- performing unit, actually, over the 8- or 9-year period of time, if I reflect back
   0.00  1 And this year again, the growth rates are well above 4%
   0.00  1 It's really a terrific unit
   0.00  1 And I believe that we are and continue to be the fastest-growing Home Care unit in the industry, so it's very well managed
   0.00  1 Brands like Domestos are growing double digit and continue to grow double digit
   0.00  1 Brands like Comfort are doing extremely well behind the different initiatives of Intense and the different perfumes that we have
   0.00  1 For example, Omo in the Middle East is growing 150%
   0.00  1 We launched that into Saudi, and it's doing extremely well for us
   0.00  1 And not surprisingly, what you see again, underlying operating margin up 130 basis points, which is well ahead of the rest of the company, if you look at it that way, and well on track to getting to its target margin by 2020
   0.00  1 Very disciplined unit, and we like to keep it that way
   0.00  1 Thank you
  -0.33  0 We'll take one more question
  -0.33  0  My first question is on margins
   0.00  1 We know we'll have strong delivery from our savings programs
   0.00  1 We'll get that through mix, we'll get that through 5-S, and we'll continue to be competitive, and there will be a nice spend
   0.00  1  A busy year
  -0.14  0 And if unification happens under whatever form and whatever shape, then that requirement most likely will also disappear
   0.06  0 And then it's indeed the right moment to have a discussion with the trust office, which is really a function also of the trust office itself on what the future of that institution should be or not, and that would be sequentially on our agenda, just to be fully transparent
   0.00  1 The most important thing for us is, without any doubt, is that we continue to operate under the highest levels of corporate governance
   0.33  0 We try to lead that in many areas
  -0.12  1 And I think that's a good thing, just like it's a good thing to be a responsible taxpayer or to welcome diversity
   0.00  1 So I thank, everybody, because we're [indiscernible] on time, as the French say, for your active engagement and for your support, our year has started well, but it will be a busy year and we're fully focused on delivering that both again on the top and bottom line, which will be then a 10th year of performance
   0.00  1 So I hope that we have all the things going for us, but it be hard work as usual, but the team here is prepared to do that
   0.00  1 So thanks for your support, and we look forward to seeing many of you during our market visits
   0.00  1 Thank you very much
   0.00  1  Thanks, everyone
   0.00  1 Thank you

   0.00  1                                                                 Good morning, everybody
  -0.20  0 We'll then cover what we believe are the most commonly asked questions about the industry and ourselves, and then maybe some uncommonly asked questions as well
   0.14  0 We'll talk about our structural response to those issues, and then outlook and conclusions
   0.25  0 And we're joined by Mark Read here in London, who leads Wunderman
   0.00 -1 So on a reported billings basis, we were up 0.6% at GBP 55.5 billion, down 3.9% on constant currency, and down 5.4% on a like-for-like basis
   0.00  1 On a revenue basis, our reported revenues are up 6.1%, at GBP 15.265 billion, up 1.6% on a constant currency basis and down 0.3% on a like-for-like basis
   0.00  1 Reported headline EBITDA was up 4.7% at GBP 2.534 billion and up 1.2% on a constant currency basis
   0.00  1 Reported headline PBIT was up 4.9% at GBP 2.267 billion, up 1.5% on a constant currency basis and reported revenues less pass-through costs margin was 17.3%, down 0.1 margin points from the 17.4% reported last year, but was flat on a constant currency basis because when you adjusted last year's 17.4% at current exchange rates, you did get to 17.3% and was flat on a like-for-like basis
   0.00  1 Headline diluted earnings per share were up 6.4% at 120.4p and up 2.7% on a constant currency basis
   0.00  1 And dividends per share of 60p, i.e., approximately a 50% payout ratio, was up 6%, in line with our target of a 50% payout
   0.09  0 Share buybacks and dividends, in line or greater than last year, and average net debt therefore coming in at 2x EBITDA, which is the top end of our 1.5x to 2x range
   0.00  1   Return on equity was up strongly, at just under 17% or at 16.9% to be precise, up from 16.2% a year ago
   0.00 -1 So turning now to some of the headline performance versus consensus, we were slightly light versus consensus on the full year revenues less pass-through costs at down 0.9%
   0.20  0 That did lead to about GBP 50 million behind consensus on the revenues
   0.00 -1 As I mentioned, the margins, on a constant currency basis, was flat with last year, but down 0.1 on a reported basis
   0.00  1 Revenues, GBP 15.265 billion on a constant currency basis up 1.6%
   0.00 -1 Average net debt I discussed, and headcount actually throughout the year was down, both on average, 1.5% and on the closing headcount, down 1.7% compared to a year ago
   0.00 -1 On a like-for-like basis, revenues were down 0.3%
   0.00  1 So overall, revenues were up 6.1%
   0.00  1 So overall, revenues less pass-through costs for the year grew from GBP 12.4 billion to GBP 13.1 billion
   0.00 -1 And in the final quarter, it was a headwind of around 3% to 3.5%
   0.67  0 This leads to a gross profit number of GBP 3.175 billion
   0.33  0 The operating profit of GBP 1.908 billion is a statutory operating profit
  -0.06  0 On the finance cost, there is a schedule in the leave-behind that breaks out the finance cost and all the various changes to financial instruments that we have to put through in that particular line as well, explained in detail for you
  -0.10  0 That's a credit on deferred tax liabilities, because our future liabilities under U.S
  -0.33  0 GAAP are now measured at 21% as opposed to 35%
   0.00  1 So in a statutory reported basis, you have reported diluted earnings per share of 142p, up nearly 27% compared to a year ago
   0.33  0 And then we had the other operating costs, leading to an operating profit for the year and PBT
   0.17  0 But actually, all the numbers are identical at the operating profit and the PBT level
  -0.06  0 What you have below and broken out for you is in the headline G&A, you have what are called the underlying cost of general and administration, which is around 6.7% of revenues of the group, and other items, like intangibles, goodwill and exceptionals, get dumped into that GBP 1.267 billion number
   0.00  1 Again, we have a slide in a second on exceptionals
   0.00  1 So revenues of GBP 15.265 billion on a constant currency basis growing by 6.1%
   0.09 -1 Operating profit, GBP 2.154 billion, was down 0.5% on a constant currency basis and the PBIT level at GBP 2.267 billion, constant currency PBIT was up 1.5%
  -0.08  0 So in terms of exceptionals, we had gain on disposal of investments and subsidiaries at Asatsu, and again, you will see in the footnotes, of the GBP 129 million, the principal gain related to Asatsu, which is a gain of GBP 92 million
  -0.12  0 And then we have had some restructuring charges taken 2017, in total of GBP 57 million, broken out in the footnotes, were predominantly comprised of severance of GBP 34 million and IT costs, including the impacts of the cyber attack, of around GBP 13 million in total for 2017
   0.00  1 So overall, our reported numbers in sterling showed growth of 6%
   0.00  1 If we were a dollar-reporting company, our overall reported growth in revenues less pass-through costs would've been 1.6%
   0.00  1   So in 2017, the first quarter, the like-for-like growth in revenues less pass-through costs was plus 0.8%
   0.00 -1 So the first half of this year, we reported revenues less pass-through costs on like-for-like basis of down 0.5%
   0.00 -1 The second half has been harder
   0.00 -1 So the second half revenues were down 1.2%, which actually is in line with where we are in January 2018
   0.00 -1 So overall for the year, our full year revenues are down 0.9%, not seeing a pickup in quarter 4 that we had hoped for
  -0.07  1 In data investment management, which represents 18% of the business revenues, we saw a decline in the first half of 1.9%, but an improvement overall and on a full year basis, the decline was 1.3%
   0.00 -1 In public relations and public affairs, we saw a full year performance of plus 0.2%, slightly lower than the rate of growth we saw in the first half, where the growth was 1.8%
   0.07  0 And in brand consulting, health and wellness and specialist communications, which represents just under 28% of the business, we saw a full year revenue less pass-through costs of plus 1%, very similar to that achieved at the half year of plus 1.1%
   0.00 -1 So overall, for the group, the first half we were down 0.5% and on a full year basis, we were down 0.9%
  -0.08  1 So in North America, which represents 36% of the business, saw overall revenues less pass-through costs decline 3.2% overall for the year, slightly higher than the half 1 rate of minus 2.2%
   0.00  1 The United Kingdom continued to perform well, it is 13% of the business, on a full year basis, it had a revenue less pass-through costs growth of 4.8%, having been growing at 3.8% in the first half
   0.00 -1 And similarly, in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe, 30% of the business, we saw revenues down 0.8%, similar to what they were down in the first half this year, minus 0.3%
  -0.10  0 So turning now to one of the comparisons we make, and we can only really do this on a revenue basis, as opposed to the revenues less pass-through costs
   0.00  1 But I think there, you can see a consistent trend when you add the 2 half years, the half 1 '16 and the half 1 '17 combined, in our case, on revenues of 4%; the half 2s of '16 and '17, when combined, show revenue growth of 1.5%
   0.00 -1 You can see the trend across the industry of softening growth and somewhat patchy growth of some of our competitors
   0.00  1 In terms of margin performance of the business, it is still a strong margin business overall
   0.07  0 And looking at the advertising and media investment management business, which is just 49% of the profits of the group, margins were flat at 19% at the full year, similar to where they were at the half year, where they were flat at 15.3%
   0.00  1 So we do have a very strong second half
   0.00 -1 The data investment management business, our second- strongest margin business, did see a margin decline at the half year of 0.5 margin points and that has continued to flow through into full year results, the margin is going from 17.6% to 17.1%, representing 15% of the business
   0.00 -1 Public relations and public affairs, 8% of the business, traditionally a good margin business as well, it did have a slightly softer second half and the margins overall for the discipline were down from 16.7% to 16.1%
   0.00 -1 In brand consulting, health and wellness and specialist communications, overall margins were down 0.1% to 15.3% versus 15.4% a year ago and a fairly mixed performance within some of that division
   0.00 -1 Western Continental Europe of basically flat revenues, saw margins held or down 0.1 margin points from 14.5% to 14.4%
   0.00  1 On a revenue basis, which is affected by those pass-through costs, we had a good performance in the U.K
   0.00 -1 But overall for the year, on a full year basis, mature markets were down 0.5% and fast-growth markets flat
   0.00  1 I think on a meaningful basis, the revenue less pass-through costs, you see here where the fourth quarter performed well and where the full year basis performed in trend
   0.00  1 Latin America, which had, had a good year, was still up, but marginally at 3.6%
   0.00 -1 But overall, we were down 0.9% in the mature markets and down 0.8% in the fast-growth markets for the year
   0.00 -1 Overall, they were down 1% on revenues and down 1.4% on revenues less pass-through costs
   0.00  1 has continued the good growth
   0.00  1 AUNZ, we're basically down, but you will see in the reported numbers from the public company, which had a good margin performance and a relatively low-digit but solid EPS performance in WPP AUNZ, reported earlier this week
   0.00 -1 In the BRICs, as we mentioned, Greater China, somewhat disappointing compared to what we'd hoped for, but down 3%
   0.00  1 India, definitely affected by GST and demonetization, had a very strong first half
   0.00  1 We were up 6% to 7% after 9 months, but had a softer fourth quarter
  -0.17  0 And Russia is a bit mixed by quarter, to be quite frank with you, and that portrays a sort of mixed quarter-on-quarter performance in Russia
   0.14  0 So overall, here's a summary of our -- the trade estimates of major new business wins throughout 2017
   0.19  0 And what we've shown here is all the wins and the accounts, those which are shaded have come through in quarter 4 and then you see a number of transfer wins coming through in the fourth quarter, actually, to -- sizable wins of GBP 400 million for media coming -- Mediacom coming, one in Europe, one in North America
   0.00  1 And as we go through our numbers, so this is our internal estimates of business performance, it's a very credible number of GBP 6.3 billion compared to the GBP 6.7 billion last year, but we were strong for the first 3 quarters, but somewhat soft or neutral in quarter 4 on the new business
   0.09  0 But the key measure is whatever we generate in operating profit, we generate in cash after depreciation and non-cash compensation, interest paid and taxes
  -0.12  0 Net initial payments were quite significant at GBP 605 million, earn-outs less so at GBP 92 million
  -0.09  0 This year, you'll see in more detail our spend on new acquisitions actually was GBP 326 million, but we had disposals where we realized proceeds of GBP 296 million
   0.00 -1 With the earn-outs going through of GBP 200 million, it meant that actually, our acquisition payments net-net were about GBP 400 million less than the year before
  -0.06  1 So our coverage ratios are strong at 13x interest and average net debt-to-EBITDA, as I mentioned, is at 2x and the trend of around GBP 4.5 billion is GBP 300 million to GBP 400 million worse, but in line with the 10% to 7% difference compared to a year ago, after the first 7 weeks of this year
  -0.12  0 But through the proceeds of disposals, the cash flow for the year had a net outflow of GBP 30 million only compared to GBP 605 million the year before
   0.00  1 Dividend increase in line with the growth of EPS and therefore, the 50% payout ratio maintained for 2017
   1.00  0 And with that, I happily hand over to Adam
   0.00  1   So we think that the outturn in 2017 was 3.1% total growth in global ad investment and this had come down a shade from the prior year, from 4.4%, which we'd had an improving global outlook, but with fixed investment looking sluggish and we were sort of neutral on Trump
   0.09  0 So we came into 2018 expecting 4.3% growth, which has been stable despite what one might argue more supportive indicators across business and consumer and trade
   0.00  1 Geographically, China and Japan are now strong and then the Eurozone is accelerating
   0.00 -1 Worries might include wages rising at the expense of profits and the commodities cycle, which was certainly warming up when we made this forecast
   0.00 -1 The relationship of GDP to advertising throughout this recovery cycle measured advertising intensity, that is the share of advertising in the global economy has fallen from 0.75 to 0.70
   0.00 -1 And I remember back in August, at this event, we were pointing out that 25 of WPP's top 60 clients were down in the first half
   0.00 -1 The other issue is under-measurement in some countries of digital, which is certainly the case
   0.00  1 But the top line here, the orange one, is the faster-growth market, which really has been faster growing, currently indexing at 150 relative to 2009
   0.00 -1 The Eurozone has shrunk 1/4 in real terms since 2009
   0.00 -1 This year, we only have 6 markets expected to go negative, which also means we are reducing our dependence slightly on this group of markets
   0.07 -1 remains resistant to all macro encouragements, it would seem, with advertisers remaining focused on reducing expense, increasing efficiency, scrutinizing digital
   0.00  1 China has steadied
   0.00  1 But generally, urbanization and rising wages support strong consumer growth there, and therefore, the ad outlook
  -0.09  0 One interesting thing that India raised was the, what you might call the channel shift, the demand of CPG through online outlets as opposed to offline, which is something also China highlighted
  -0.29  1 And as a footnote, I would mention Russia, which is growing strongly but not big enough to break into this list quite
   0.00  1 E-commerce, the volume of e-commerce grew 17% in 2017, in line with our forecast, taking it past USD 2 trillion
   0.00  1 And what I found interesting about those 2 figures is for the first time, that's substantially faster than the growth in Internet penetration, which is about 5% in the 40 countries that we monitor
  -0.14  0 Byron Sharp is telling us that big brands are not dying, but may be wasting money on unproven new media
  -0.10  0 We might also see a new kink in the product life cycle, as web endemics find limits to what they can sell in the digital domain
  -0.12  0 And at the bottom of the funnel, we see inflation in cost per click, as the old problem of last-click economics tends to cause advertisers to bid for -- all to bid on the same audience, which is something GDPR may exacerbate, but that might come up later, of course
  -0.10  0 Anyway, I will just move on to the question posed: How big can digital get? Well, what I've done here is rank the world's advertising markets according to their digital advertising intensity, put them into quarters
   0.13  0 GroupM China calls this Internet-plus and it's usually just part of a wider retail reform, shortening of time to market and integrating omnichannel better
  -0.08  1 So I conclude from this that unless something happens to stop it, then digital global share has a momentum that would reach 50% of global advertising, which at the current rate would take about 7 years
  -0.09  0 Now one must always caveat these with the qualification that digital is becoming a more blurred definition and there's quite a bit of TV money in there now, which is masquerading as digital
   0.00  1 TV hours remain healthy
   0.25  0 And the viewing hours remain stable
  -0.10  0 And so TV content is going to be part of that story, even if it's called digital, and TV with the most diffused distribution has the youngest profile
   0.00  1  Thank you
  -0.17  0 I thought it would just be worthwhile running through some of the most commonly asked questions by yourselves and others
  -0.17  0 So we'll try and address all of these in a limited period of time
   0.05  0 And for the first time, Google and Facebook in 2017, the year that's just closed, closed as the top 2 media destinations for us, Google and Facebook together   accounting for about $7 billion out of about $75 billion of media spend, remembering, and we talked about this last year, that the long tail constitutes something like 70% of -- to our knowledge, 70% of Google and Facebook's volume
   0.09  0 The third group, grouping and obviously, there's a lot of flux in relation to this group, the 21st Century Fox, News Corp, Sky nexus, and depending on where that ends up, if it does end up elsewhere, either at Comcast or Disney or a mixture of both, those would be really, the third, fourth and fifth destinations
   0.22  0 Firstly, the SWARM creative partnership, this creative forum that brings us and Google much more closely together across the world
   0.08  0 Everybody's focused on cost, the real opportunities, obviously for our clients, are the next billion consumers, who are not going to come from Western Europe or the U.S
   0.25  0 With Facebook, we have the Creative Ambassadors Program
   0.22  0 It's a joint initiative that we developed exclusively and specifically with them for our creative and digital agencies
   0.03  0 With Amazon, we've focused on leading the way in providing a unified approach with Amazon, connecting media and e-commerce capabilities in both organizations and Mark maybe can talk a little bit more about that in connection with what's happening with MindShare and POSSIBLE and also Wunderman Commerce, which is located in Seattle, where Amazon HQ is currently based, although they will be adding to their HQs in the U.S
   0.00  1 Alibaba, we have a unique strategic relationship, which combines GroupM's platform, its data capability, with Alibaba's Uni Marketing products
   0.05  0 In addition to that, on the data end, there's a whole host, there are 6 key relationships with partners, with Google, with Facebook, with Amazon, with Crossix, with Mobilewalla and Spotify, where we are using our data and their data to try and develop unique and unprecedented insights
   0.07  0 In addition to that, we're using our data insights, the [m]Platform at GroupM, to develop a single source of truth for media activity
   0.05  0 We do have activist investors, we do have zero- based budgeters, who are putting very significant emphasis on short-term cost management, and I have to point out that the activist investors, to be fair to them, there are several, but the most prominent probably being Dan Loeb and Nelson Peltz, who do emphasize that what they are interested in is innovation and branding
   0.00 -1 But in that context, it is having a significant impact on the patterns of growth
   0.14  0 And if you look at the leading CPG clients, these are leading WPP CPG clients, and look what's been happening to price -- organic growth, price and volume
  -0.33  0 The trends are quite significant
   0.00 -1 So there is this issue, I think in the longer term
   0.00 -1 Most people who -- and it has to be admitted, these are people who have been in packaged goods companies for long periods of time, believe that as volumes come under pressure and there's a lack of volume growth, increased investment in 2 things: Innovation and branding
   0.50  0 You can't have innovation without branding, but you can't have the branding without the innovation
   0.20  0 They go two in lockstep, so you need innovation and branding to make things work
   0.07  0 And you have this valuation discrepancy, that you have information technology and these are the updated figures from figures that we showed you before, the information technology S&P 500 growing at just under 10%, their price earnings multiple are about 19x
  -0.07  0 So you have multiple channels, omnichannel growth -- development planning programs, obviously, is critically important, but with very significantly different growth rates
   0.00 -1 And it is a mixed picture on this
   0.00  1 Hogarth, we've announced today that Hogarth will be, which is our production management platform, digital production management platform, which is growing very significantly in the last 3 to 4 years, it's tripled its revenues over that period of time with a number of very significant clients
   0.00  1 And we are seeing programmatic and performance agencies continuing to grow
   0.00  1 Xaxis is gaining traction
  -0.13  0 We've cooperated with them in content studios with media investment management, with data with the data investment management and in content studios through our public relation agencies as well
  -0.08  0 And recent examples, recent data as we put it here, do indicate that in-house programmatic and content studios may be going out-house as much as in-house, and there is, it's true, some to-ing and fro-ing in both areas
   0.00 -1 In terms of innovation and branding, whatever we say about the environment and the technological disruption and the short-term pressure on costs, the general environment, the new normal, where that GDP growth is at 3% or 4%, is really basically low GDP growth in the sense of subtrend to what we saw pre-Lehman
  -0.06  0 There is little or no inflation, I know it's the issue that people are preoccupied, certainly, from a market part of view and interest rate point of view, but basically, it's very limited inflation, at least to date since Lehman
   0.00 -1 And therefore, clients have very little pricing power and they're still very focused on costs
   0.00  1 Morgan Stanley have been consistent -- or come to the view that these 40 brands have been consistently increasing brand -- those that have been increasing, consistently increasing brand investment, have an average 50% faster growth rate than peers that haven't
   0.00  1 And the secondary point, which is equally or maybe even more important, is not only does A&P spend boosts sales, it also builds barriers to entry, which allows FMCG companies to earn returns far in excess of their cost of capital and ultimately drives valuation
  -0.05  1 This is going to become critically important as Amazon, in particular, and Alibaba and Tencent as well, start to build their platforms, and particularly Amazon, according to some estimates, the advertising platform last year was up to about $2.5 billion, $3 billion, so it's a tiddler in relation to Google and Facebook, who were at $100 billion and $40 billion, respectively
   0.00  1 But it is growing very rapidly
   0.00  1 So building brands through innovation and through branding becomes critically important
   0.00  1 So clear evidence that investment in A&P works in terms of long-term sales growth, building the moat and in terms of value for shareholders
  -0.33  1 And this is where it's critically important
   0.40  0 We have been certainly going in the direction of integrating our offer more effectively
  -0.05  0 But because of the things that we've just gone through just now and these questions that are being asked, one way or another, some of them long term and more structural and some of them short term and therefore more cyclical, we have to do, in our view, 4 things: Simplify our verticals, and Mark is here and he can give you a view of what's been happening at Wunderman and that's been significant in terms of a number of brands that we've consolidated with Wunderman
   0.14  0 We have 50, 51 client leaders cover about 1/3 of our business, integrating our offer across clients throughout the group
   0.05  0 Thirdly, appointing country managers and subregional leaders to try and integrate at a country level, but also to respond to the local or regional piranha, some call them piranha, the West tends to call them piranha, the Chinese tend to call them gladiator brands, that are building at a local level
   0.12  0 And finally, horizontalizing, for want of a better word, certain function systems and platforms
   0.05  0 And that leads you to a structure with our functional, let's call them 7 functional areas, that's advertising, media, data, brand consulting, public relations, health and wellness and specialist communications, which is basically our digital capabilities
   0.00  1 And core tech in the IT area is a good example of the initiatives we're taking there
   0.08  0 But in talent, in finance property, procurement, information technology and indeed in practices, we're building and have built horizontal connections
   0.25  0 So finally, in terms of outlook and conclusions
   0.00  1 Reported revenue and revenue less pass-through costs, growth last year was 6%
   0.00 -1 Like-for-like revenue less pass-through cost was just under minus 1%
   0.00 -1 Reported margin was down 0.1 margin points, but flat in terms of constant currency in like-for-like
   0.00  1 Reported headline diluted EPS growth was at 120.4p was up over 6%
   0.00  1 Return on equity was up to 16.9%, against a slightly lower WACC, weighted average cost of capital, of 6.3%
   0.00  1 Dividend was increased to 60p, up 6%, which represents a 50% payout ratio
   0.00  1 The tailwind -- the ForEx tailwind reduces and   becomes a headwind from Q4 of 2017, plus 14%
   0.00  1 Q1 is plus 10%
   0.00  1 Q2 is plus 2%
   0.00 -1 Q3 was minus 3%
   0.00  1 Revenue less pass-through costs were down by just over 1%, but above budget
   0.07  0 If you make more extravagant assumptions about revenue growth or margin improvement, you get, obviously, a result that's closer to the upper end of that range
  -0.17  0 Now if I -- in terms of the budgets, there've been a number of questions before we started about the budgets for 2018
  -0.08  0 Obviously, we're sort of embarrassed by what happened in the last 3 quarters of the year, where we were overoptimistic or we accepted overoptimistic forecasts on the top line
   0.00  1 And we're budgeting flat like-for-like revenue and revenue less pass-through cost growth for the whole of 2018, but with a slower first half and a stronger second half
   0.00 -1 At current exchange rates, the full year currency impact is 4%, a 4% decrease to revenue and revenue less pass-through cost
  -0.06  1 We're going to meet that operating margin objective by managing our absolute costs and increasing the flexibility to adapt our cost structure to these significant market changes that we tried to go through in this presentation
  -0.33  0 So we'll now open it up for questions
   0.06  0 I think it was Interpublic, who mentioned sort of on their call, that in terms of net new business wins, they gave a very specific sort of statement that, that would drive organic revenue growth in 2018
   0.14  0 Now sort of if you look at your comps, they are easily in the second half, but you haven't given that in your statement
   0.00 -1 So just wondering, sort of it may be implicitly in there because you said January's sort of down
   0.07  0 But sort of can you make a statement now that you would expect sort of the position to actually pick up in the second half of the year and things will be second half weighted?  Well, I'll give a go, and then Paul can respond as well
  -0.14  0 On net new business -- well, let me just try and answer all 3 questions in 1 way
   0.20 -1 We think that's been too optimistic in the environment that we saw in 2017
   0.00 -1 I don't know whether anybody else has as well, but we didn't see as -- revenues were flat
   0.00 -1 But what we used to call net sales, revenue less pass-through costs were down 1.2%
   0.00 -1 But if that's indicative, we just felt that it was best to be cautious
   0.00 -1 So we said to the operating companies "Take down your top line." And that, of course -- again, because in the last 9 months of last year, if you look at headcount for last year, we were down about 1.5%, if I remember rightly, on headcount
   0.00 -1 So you would normally expect that to exhibit some significant restraint on the staff costs to revenue ratio, but it didn't
   0.20  0 Probably because the most easy explanation for it will be an expansion in freelance
   0.00 -1 But you've seen enough public announcements on what's been happening to agency costs to know that there is pressure in the system
  -0.20  0 So it really answers your net new business question
   0.00  1 I mean, if you went back a year, we had some -- we had 2 big losses to deal with, which, actually, our businesses have done a very good   job in picking up new business not on the scale of those 2, some wins approaching that scale, but basically filled the gap and gave us a little bit more room to maneuver
   0.00  1 We think it's the sensible thing to do to take down people's expectations
   0.00 -1 I mean, I'd say on new business also, what the trade report is obviously the -- mainly media wins or losses because of scale
  -0.11  1 And one of the businesses I think we do see a significant pickup in performance is the media business, quite frankly
   0.00 -1 And I think the other reason why, to a certain degree, we're cautious, we've had a number of budgets in over the years where we've seen a very strong third quarter
  -0.20  0 And quite frankly, it hasn't panned out
   0.00 -1 And yes, it's difficult to be absolutely precise in January about what new business you're going to win in quarter 3
   0.00 -1 So I think partly, it's the caution around what we're trying to achieve
   0.00  1 The second thing in my mind is we are looking, in our case, I think a pretty strong performance will bounce back in our Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and Middle Eastern market, which turns to be very, very solid for us, very good
   0.00 -1 I think on balance, a disappointment to us in how they -- what they achieved in 2017
  -1.00  0 3 questions as well
   0.00 -1 I apologize
  -0.10  0 Second question, I think in the past, you've mentioned the growth rates of the top 20 clients, whether you can either give us that number or at least directionally indicate whether the big clients are spending at a faster or slower rate than the group average
  -0.17  0 And then final question, one -- actually, specifically with P&G
  -0.10  0 I'm just trying to get a sense of whether that's a good or a bad thing if it develops into a trend more broadly for WPP
   0.00 -1 So I think you -- the pattern was   December '16 probably was not as strong as we've seen
   0.00  1 We tended to see surges in the fourth quarter
   0.00 -1 So I -- was there anything -- reverse budget flushes, that would seem to suggest that the pressures that we saw had more of an impact in that final quarter, in that final month than historically
   0.00 -1 On the top clients, I think it's fair to say that the top 20 clients probably were down further than the group average if you looked at revenue and revenue less pass-through cost
   0.17  0 Not so easy to check on the spot, but yes, I would agree with you
  -0.12  0 And I think if I look at the top 30, it's fairly evenly balanced between those that are growing and those that are declining
  -0.17  0  And then it's wrong for us to comment on specific clients
   0.06 -1 But despite the pressure, I think P&G commented specifically on the number of agencies they had and that they had consolidated down the number of agencies to 2,500, I think was the figure that they close it, and that's not a dissimilar situation to other situations
   0.25  0 It depends on which way they consolidate it, obviously
  -0.29  0 First of all, on margin, a bit of a short-term question and long-term question
   0.25  0 Of course, in 2018 you don't have that benefit of associates
  -0.11  1 And in the long run, I mean, I know accounting differs from one company to the other, but your margins are quite significantly higher than others
   0.00  1 So in that sense, it's going to be a much more steady-state to the associate income in 2018
  -0.12  0 In terms of margins and bonuses, I think it was one of the questions, yes, there was a reduction in bonuses last year
    nan -1 It was down about 13%
  -0.08  1 If I recall the slides from a year ago, we said we had billings of around GBP 1.1 billion and good sort of mid- to high digit-single figure growth for the business
  -0.07  1 It's ended up with mid- to single high-digit growth, specifically through very strong performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America and good sort of, I'd call, B-plus performance in Europe, quite frankly
   0.00  1 So the revenues and billings have grown on a combined basis to about GBP 1.4 billion
   0.00  1 Return to growth in the U.S.A., and strong -- and continuing strong performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America
  -0.17  0 And as we mentioned in the press release, we've gone from around 3,300 clients signed up to over 4,000
   0.00  1 So I think it is gaining momentum
   0.00  1 It's solid and is a good performer for the group
   0.00  1 And I think this speaks for itself
   0.00 -1 I draw your attention -- we can't say it's confidential on the top 2, but I draw your attention to the first one, which you might be surprised if you knew what it was
   0.00  1 That's good
  -0.12  0 And there's been some talk of maybe disposing or partnering parts of market research
  -0.10  0 Is that still part of your plans?  The mention of the disposal or parts of market research, what we call data investment management
  -0.33  0 I thought you said disposal
  -1.00  0  Or disposal
  -0.50  0 And we think it is critical
  -0.21  0 I think when we were asked I think in the third quarter whether we would dispose -- I think it was either you or somebody else asked whether we would dispose of the data investment management business, I said we would not dispose of it
   0.00  1 But we think it's extremely important
   0.00  1 That area where Hogarth is in, we've seen very rapid growth
   0.00  1 We see very rapid growth, obviously, in digital and digital media
   0.00  1 And the last area that we've seen significant growth has been the marriage of data with media, and we've alluded that -- to that in the presentation as well
  -0.22  0 So I think disengaging from data in the way that you're suggesting, or your question is suggesting, is -- would probably be weakening
   0.06  0 And I think the fundamental premise that you started with, which is it links to the advertising and media business, it's -- what's happening in the advertising and media business is the traditional creative business is where the pressure is
   0.00 -1 The media business, all parts of the business have some -- have pressure in some way, shape or form, but I would say less on the media business than the advertising
   0.33  0 Were you dismayed or pleased to see that announcement?  It could be both
  -0.50  0 A couple of questions
   0.07  0 Perhaps you're focusing too much on winning new clients rather than extracting -- sorry, extracting may not be the right word -- working more closely with your existing customers to get more growth out of the customers that you have
  -0.08  0 Perhaps maybe stripping out account losses in the year, how did that business perform?  We could -- we wouldn't give you a separation between the advertising and media
  -0.15  0 On the existing billings or billings point, focusing on the existing business is a critical part of it as well, and I wouldn't disagree with the comment
  -0.07  0 But the drift of your question, if you look at what's happened in terms of revenues as a proportion of billings, or revenues less pass-through costs as a proportion of the business, that's increased
   1.00  0 Then there are other opportunities
   0.25 -1 Creative has taken a backseat I think
   0.04  0 I mean, Mark, do you want to comment on new business activities from a digital perspective?  I mean, I think there's a tremendous amount of digitally driven new business activity, a lot driven by companies looking at how they reorganize their tech stack, how they work with Adobe, Salesforce, other partners
   0.18  0 And I think increasingly, you see, I think particularly in the media review, desire for integration of media with -- I mean, the creative work but maybe less the creative work than with the client's data and its technology stack
  -0.18  0    So to the early part of the question, there's no doubt that we apply more focus to plugging any leaks in our bucket than we do on filling it from the top
   0.00  1 That's just good common sense
   0.00  1 On extraction rates, the good news for us is that the media landscape continues to increase in complexity
   0.00  1 And complexity is -- contributes to our extraction rate because compared to 10, 15 years ago when digital was a smaller component, our extraction rates today are significantly higher
   0.00  1 That's the good news
   0.14  0 The other point I would make is that when we win a piece of business, we go in with a defined scope
  -0.20  0 And both of those things I think address the heart of the question that you asked
  -0.50  0 And thirdly, this might be a question for Mark, if I may
  -0.20  0 The implication there is you got more cost per thousand inflation as a component
  -0.50  0  I think it's more Adam question than a Mark question
   0.15  0 But equally, they will encourage us to seek out alternatives, and so I'm not sure that it makes sense to talk of sort of price leadership in markets which are so automated
   0.00  1 And when you're doing that, it's better not to do it with the pure objective of trying to optimize cost
   0.00  1 I think you'll see ad load on Instagram increasing
  -0.33  0 Your second question on financial?  [indiscernible]  Implications?  It was whether there are financial implications, restructuring charges, cost savings we should think about
  -0.20  0 There'll be some restructuring expenses but within the context of what we normally do
  -0.50  0 No biggie abnormal restructuring expense
  -0.12  0 Because I'm not sure based on the explanation you've given today, how much of the stuff you think is structural versus cyclical?  It's an impossible question to answer
   0.14  0 You go to either end of the spectrum probably with the spend depending on what your vested interest is
   0.00 -1 If you look at the CPG stuff, that clearly to some extent is cyclical
  -0.06  0 I mean, is there a company that you have come across or that Ogilvy is aware of where you've seen in the context of WPP that isn't going through some form of transformational production, marketing, distribution challenge?  No
  -0.15  1 They are either quite invested in moving up the digital maturity curve and they've been creating business value for some time, by competing with disrupters and doing well
   0.06  0 There's some who are kind of in the middle, they might spend a lot and might try a lot of things but they're not necessarily getting the digital ROI that they want, or they need to get to compete better
  -0.08  0 And then there's quite a few who are still stuck at the starting line, who are legacy companies that have a lot of baggage, they have a lot of expense in their data systems and the things that are hard to change
  -0.33  0 They're quite careful about that
   0.00 -1 But I think we -- and there's got to be some cyclical stuff here and there's got to be some structural stuff
  -0.07  0 If you were to dot the same definition in terms of business transformation or digital transformation or whatever, however you describe that, what proportion of your revenues come from that now and where do you want -- where do you think it should go to?  Well, we -- impossible to log
   0.11  0  To some extent, I prefer not to think about cyclical versus structural but how you position the business for growth
   0.11  0 To be honest, I think it's a bit grand to call that a digital transformation project, but effectively, that's what it is
   0.04  0 We're building Sainsbury's e-commerce platform, and not just the website but literally going how they pick the product in-store, how they schedule the vans, how they integrate the order management system into the line of availability to store level, how when   you arrive at the website, it determines which of the delivery stocks you find available
   0.05  0 So I think we can work on those complex transformation projects in a lead program management role, so we're currently replatforming an online retailer from this in-house systems to IBM WebSphere Commerce
  -0.50  0 Bright Side or has it been snowed under? That's my first question
  -1.00  0 The second question..
  -0.33  0  The second question is on Mediapalooza again
  -0.14  0 So you said that you didn't think it would be different this year, but your competitors disagree
  -1.00  0 That is my second question
  -0.50  0  And the third question is on your..
  -0.25  0    And then the last question is on your structural response
  -0.08  0 Actually, it's very significant because you take Kantar, you take Ogilvy and you know yourself we don't break out Ogilvy separately
   0.33  0 I mean, these are prototypes effectively and the same thing is true of Ogilvy
   0.00  1 I mean, Wunderman itself is over $1 billion in revenue, and that's brought in -- do you want to comment on?  If you look at where we are today, we're I think 65% bigger than we were 3 years ago, not by organic growth alone but by consolidation of the business
   0.00  1 I think the strategy that we've been developing, which is really moving quickly into execution is to become one Ogilvy as a brand and as a face to our client to still have the deep, deep capability expertise in areas like digital, certainly some of the things like PR and influence that have been important growth areas for us
  -0.25  0 So we will still have those capabilities, but we will go to market as Ogilvy, losing the Mather
   0.00  1 We want to be able to build the kind of programs that every single business has to build to do to be on the intimacy level with their customers today, that means heavy data, heavy digital and delivering quarterly results, whether it's in users or sales or however the metrics work
   0.00  1 And then very importantly, we want to be able to deliver pulse and the content and brand information and knowledge that has to come out every single minute of the day and the way the world works now
   0.00  1 We're building out a toolset and we're taking all of our top 20 markets through the ability to deliver that to clients
  -0.17  1 So we think that's going to make quite a big difference in 2018 and beyond
  -0.09  0  Yes, so just to answer your question head on, it's affecting and taking Wavemaker on its own; that's not GroupM
  -0.29  0 So I mean, we've done quite a bit of centralization within GroupM for quite a number of years
  -0.20  0 It's quite an obvious thing to do in the media sector
   0.00  1 As we scale, the value of that data increases
  -0.25  0 And there was an earlier question about trading leverage
  -0.33  0 My first question is on your outlook
   0.00  1 You said that you're planning extremely conservatively
  -0.17  0 Second question   is on your -- the FX impact on margin
  -0.10  0 I mean, it's very difficult for me to comment on that because I don't know the basis on which they've done it
   0.12 -1 So the Olympics, which were successful, the World Cup and the midterm congressional should harden the markets a little bit
  -0.25  0 On working capital, it is complicated
   0.00  1 So in the back of the accounts, you've got the split out between what I called trade working capital, which last year was an improvement of GBP 180 million and this year was a deterioration of GBP 261 million, to be precise
   0.00 -1 It is -- we have some various pension obligations, it happens to be the obligations on the pension are lower than they were a year ago
   0.00 -1 So between pensions, NIC, bonuses, that is all the nontrade impact on the provision change, but they actually want to call true underlying working capital as measured by trade receivables, trade payables, has deteriorated but really given back that improvement we made a year ago of GBP 180 million to an outflow GBP 261 million
   0.25  0 Again, it's a point-to-point 31st of December to 31st of December position
   0.00  1 So I don't deny, there is some pressure on trade working capital, but we've actually done a pretty good job overall
  -1.00  0 Three questions
  -0.50  0 That's the first question
  -0.25  0  The second question just comes to the new sort of earnings number
   0.00 -1 I mean, obviously first half revenues were minus 0.5, second quarter down minus 0.7 -- 1.7
  -0.07  0 So the answer to that question about first half versus second half is it reflects the pattern that we got in the bottom-up budgets, but with a blanket reduction pushed down on the top part
   0.00  1 And obviously, we will have a strong chance of growing with those industries themselves are growing strongly
   0.17  0 And telecommunications actually, I think there's a little bit more opportunity there
  -0.12  0   There's quite an overlap areas in digital that are working the data hardest
  -0.25  0 So I think, I can't remember who it was who asked the question, just to make that quite clear
  -0.25  0 We're all here if you want to ask any further questions
